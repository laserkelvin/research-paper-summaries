          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions
remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of materials.
Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between
electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate
\textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity
that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to
study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as reactions, ion
migrations, phase transformations, and degradation.
  In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network
(CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a
graph-neural-network-based force field to model a universal potential energy
surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic
moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over
10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of
$\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic
moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy
of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic
degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in
solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in
Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li
diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of
including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we
provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of
freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Synthesis prediction is a key accelerator for the rapid design of advanced
materials. However, determining synthesis variables such as the choice of
precursor materials is challenging for inorganic materials because the sequence
of reactions during heating is not well understood. In this work, we use a
knowledge base of 29,900 solid-state synthesis recipes, text-mined from the
scientific literature, to automatically learn which precursors to recommend for
the synthesis of a novel target material. The data-driven approach learns
chemical similarity of materials and refers the synthesis of a new target to
precedent synthesis procedures of similar materials, mimicking human synthesis
design. When proposing five precursor sets for each of 2,654 unseen test target
materials, the recommendation strategy achieves a success rate of at least 82%.
Our approach captures decades of heuristic synthesis data in a mathematical
form, making it accessible for use in recommendation engines and autonomous
laboratories.</p>

          <p>We present a lightweight, flexible, and high-performance framework for
inferring the properties of gravitational-wave events. By combining likelihood
heterodyning, automatically-differentiable and accelerator-compatible
waveforms, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling enhanced
by normalizing flows, we achieve full Bayesian parameter estimation for real
events like GW150914 and GW170817 within a minute of sampling time. Our
framework does not require pretraining or explicit reparameterizations and can
be generalized to handle higher dimensional problems. We present the details of
our implementation and discuss trade-offs and future developments in the
context of other proposed strategies for real-time parameter estimation. Our

          <p>The agriculture sector has many issues such as reductions of agricultural
lands, growing population, health issues arising due to the use of synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides, reduction in soil health due to extreme use of
synthetic chemicals during farming, etc. The quality and quantity of foods
required for living things are affected by many factors like scarcity of
nutrient-rich soils, lack of suitable fertilizers, harmful insects and bugs,
climate change, etc. There is a requirement to supply the proper nutrients to
plants/crops for obtaining a high crop yield. Synthetic chemical fertilizers
provide nutrients (macro and micro) to plants for their growth and development
but the excess use of them is not good for a healthy lifestyle as well as for
the environment. In recent years, non-thermal plasma (NTP) is considered as an
advanced green technology for enhancing productivity in agriculture sectors. In
this report, we provided the details of nutrients and their functions in the
growth and development of plants/crops. How plasma technology can resolve many
future challenges in the agriculture sector is discussed in detail. A few
experiments on seed germination and plant growth (root and shoot length) were
performed in the laboratory to explore the effect of plasma-activated water on
the growth and development of plants. These primary results demonstrate the
great potential of plasma technology in the agriculture sector.</p>

exhaustive detail, we contrast the performance of force, energy, and stress

Early transition metals present higher relative errors and are more difficult

these metals. Increasing the fictitious electronic temperature (smearing)
modifies the angular sensitivity of forces and makes the early transition metal
forces easier to learn. This work illustrates challenges in capturing intricate

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper introduces WhereWulff, a semi-autonomous workflow for modeling the
reactivity of catalyst surfaces. The workflow begins with a bulk optimization
task that takes an initial bulk structure, and returns the optimized bulk
geometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The
stable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates
surfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface
energies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent
adsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff
construction shape. The workflow handles computational resource constraints
such as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis. We
illustrate the workflow for oxygen evolution (OER) intermediates on two double
perovskites. WhereWulff nearly halved the number of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations from ~ 240 to ~ 132 by prioritizing terminations, up to a
maximum Miller index of 1, based on surface stability. Additionally, it
automatically handled the 180 additional re-submission jobs required to
successfully converge 120+ atoms systems under a 48-hour wall-time cluster
constraint. There are four main use cases that we envision for WhereWulff: (1)
as a first-principles source of truth to validate and update a closed-loop
self-sustaining materials discovery pipeline, (2) as a data generation tool,
(3) as an educational tool, allowing users (e.g. experimentalists) unfamiliar
with OER modeling to probe materials they might be interested in before doing
further in-domain analyses, (4) and finally as a starting point for users to
extend with reactions other than OER, as part of a collaborative software
community.</p>
