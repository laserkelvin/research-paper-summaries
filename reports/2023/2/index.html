          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions
remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of materials.
Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between
electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate
\textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity
that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to
study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as reactions, ion
migrations, phase transformations, and degradation.
  In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network
(CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a
graph-neural-network-based force field to model a universal potential energy
surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic
moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over
10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of
$\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic
moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy
of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic
degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in
solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in
Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li
diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of
including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we
provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of
freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Synthesis prediction is a key accelerator for the rapid design of advanced
materials. However, determining synthesis variables such as the choice of
precursor materials is challenging for inorganic materials because the sequence
of reactions during heating is not well understood. In this work, we use a
knowledge base of 29,900 solid-state synthesis recipes, text-mined from the
scientific literature, to automatically learn which precursors to recommend for
the synthesis of a novel target material. The data-driven approach learns
chemical similarity of materials and refers the synthesis of a new target to
precedent synthesis procedures of similar materials, mimicking human synthesis
design. When proposing five precursor sets for each of 2,654 unseen test target
materials, the recommendation strategy achieves a success rate of at least 82%.
Our approach captures decades of heuristic synthesis data in a mathematical
form, making it accessible for use in recommendation engines and autonomous
laboratories.</p>
