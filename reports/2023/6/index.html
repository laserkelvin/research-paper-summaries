          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Equivariant Transformers such as Equiformer have demonstrated the efficacy of
applying Transformers to the domain of 3D atomistic systems. However, they are
limited to small degrees of equivariant representations due to their
computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate whether these
architectures can scale well to higher degrees. Starting from Equiformer, we
first replace $SO(3)$ convolutions with eSCN convolutions to efficiently
incorporate higher-degree tensors. Then, to better leverage the power of higher
degrees, we propose three architectural improvements -- attention
re-normalization, separable $S^2$ activation and separable layer normalization.
Putting this all together, we propose EquiformerV2, which outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on large-scale OC20 dataset by up to $9\%$ on forces,
$4\%$ on energies, offers better speed-accuracy trade-offs, and $2\times$
reduction in DFT calculations needed for computing adsorption energies.
Additionally, EquiformerV2 trained on only OC22 dataset outperforms GemNet-OC
trained on both OC20 and OC22 datasets, achieving much better data efficiency.
Finally, we compare EquiformerV2 with Equiformer on QM9 and OC20 S2EF-2M
datasets to better understand the performance gain brought by higher degrees.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve upon the previous state of the art in terms of predicting the energy of an adsorbate on a catalyst surface using machine learning. They identify that the current methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational cost, and thus propose new architectural improvements to address these issues.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in terms of predicting the energy of an adsorbate on a catalyst surface using machine learning was the EquiformerV2 model proposed by Liao and Smidt (2023). The current paper improves upon this model by introducing new architectural improvements, such as increasing the maximum sequence length (Lmax), using eSCN convolutions, attention re-normalization, normalization of the input, and separable layer normalization. These improvements lead to improved performance in terms of lower MAE values compared to the EquiformerV2 model.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted ablation studies on the proposed architectural improvements using the task of ∆ε on the QM9 dataset. They evaluated the performance of the different variants of the model and identified which improvements led to better results.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 6 and Table 14 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 6 shows qualitative examples of the initial configuration of an adsorbate on a catalyst surface and the corresponding relaxed configurations obtained from different models, while Table 14 presents the results of ablation studies on the proposed architectural improvements.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel method for open cluster membership determination that leverages quadtree features, which could significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of this process in the context of large surveys such as Gaia DR3.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The enhancement of a cryogenic radio frequency 22 pole trap instrument by the
addition of ring electrodes is presented in detail. The ring electrodes tightly
surround the poles and only a fraction of the applied electric potential
penetrates to the trap axis, facilitating the fine control of slow cold ions. A
precise computational model, describing the effective mechanical potential
created by the applied static and rf fields, governing the ion behaviour, is
employed to demonstrate and understand the operation of our setup. The use of
ring electrodes for improved extraction of cold stored ions is shown. Variable
trapping potentials, placed on one ring electrode, can be used to control the
evaporation of only those $\text{H}^+$ ions from the trap, whose kinetic energy
exceeds the barrier. This ring electrode trapping opens new possibilities to
study processes of minimal kinetic energy release, e. g. spin exchange. We
propose a robust modified method for the determination of temperature dependent
ion molecule reaction rates, resistant to effects caused by neutral gas
freezing and demonstrate it on the reaction of $\text{CO}^+$/$\text{CO}_2^+$
with $\text{H}_2$/$\text{D}_2$. Finally, the use of a supercontinuum laser for
quick localisation of spectroscopic bands is examined on the $\text{N}_2^+$

          <p>The clear sky instantaneous radiative forcings of the 14 halogenated gases
previously shown to have the largest contribution to global warming, were
found. The calculation used the absorption cross sections for the halogenated
gases which are assumed to be independent of temperature as well as over 1/3
million line strengths for the 5 naturally occurring greenhouse gases: H$_2$O,
CO$_2$, O$_3$, CH$_4$ and N$_2$O, from the Hitran database. The total radiative
forcing of the halogenated gases at their 2020 concentrations is 0.52 (0.67)
W/m$^2$ at the tropopause (mesopause). Over half of this forcing is due to
CFC11 and CFC12 whose concentrations are declining as a result of the Montreal
Protocol. The rate of total forcing change for all 14 halogenated gases is 1.5
(2.2) mW/m$^2$/year at the tropopause (mesopause). The calculations assumed a
constant altitude concentration for all halogenated gases except CFC11, CFC12
and SF$_6$. Using the observed altitude dependence for those 3 molecules
reduced their radiative forcings by about 10%. The global warming potential
values were comparable to those given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. The contribution of a gas to global warming was estimated using the
forcing power per molecule defined as the derivative of its radiative forcing
with respect to its column density. For the present atmosphere, the
per-molecule forcing powers of halogenated gases are orders of magnitude larger
than those for the 5 naturally occuring greenhouse gases because the latter
have much higher concentrations and are strongly saturated. But, the rates of
concentration increase of the 5 main greenhouse gases are orders of magnitude
greater than that of any halogenated gas. Assuming the temperature increase
caused by each gas is proportional to its radiative forcing increase, the 14
halogenated gases are responsible for only 2% of the total global warming.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the most fundamental hypotheses in astrochemistry and astrobiology
states that crucial biotic molecules like glycine (NH$_2$CH$_2$COOH) found in
meteorites and comets are inherited from early phases of star formation. Most
observational searches for glycine in the interstellar medium have focused on
warm, high-mass molecular cloud sources. However, recent studies suggest that
it might be appropriate to shift the observational focus to cold, low-mass
sources. We aim to detect glycine towards the so-called methanol hotspot in the
Barnard 5 dark cloud. The hotspot is a cold source ($T_\mathrm{gas}\approx 7.5$
K) with yet high abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) and water in
the gas phase. We carried out deep, pointed observations with the Onsala 20m
telescope, targeting several transitions of glycine conformers I and II (Gly-I
and Gly-II) in the frequency range $70.2$-$77.9$ GHz. No glycine lines are
detected towards the targeted position, but we use a line stacking procedure to
derive sensitive abundance upper limits w.r.t. H$_2$ for Gly-I and Gly-II, i.e.
$\leq(2$-$5)\times10^{-10}$ and $\leq(0.7$-$3)\times10^{-11}$, respectively.
The obtained Gly-II upper limits are the most stringent for a cold source,
while the Gly-I upper limits are mostly on the same order as previously
measured limits. The measured abundances w.r.t. H$_2$ of other COMs at the B5
methanol hotspot range from $2\times10^{-10}$ (acetaldehyde) to
$2\times10^{-8}$ (methanol). Hence, based on a total glycine upper limit of
$(2$-$5)\times10^{-10}$, we cannot rule out that glycine is present but
undetected.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report ALMA high-angular resolution (~ 50 au) observations of the binary
system SVS13-A. More specifically, we analyse deuterated water (HDO) and sulfur
dioxide (SO2) emission. The molecular emission is associated with both the
components of the binary system, VLA4A and VLA4B. The spatial distribution is
compared to that of formamide (NH2CHO), previously analysed in the system.
Deuterated water reveals an additional emitting component spatially coincident
with the dust accretion streamer, at a distance larger than 120 au from the
protostars, and at blue-shifted velocities (> 3 km/s from the systemic
velocities). We investigate the origin of the molecular emission in the
streamer, in light of thermal sublimation temperatures calculated using updated
binding energies (BE) distributions. We propose that the observed emission is
produced by an accretion shock at the interface between the accretion streamer
and the disk of VLA4A. Thermal desorption is not completely excluded in case
the source is actively experiencing an accretion burst.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a flexible multi-modal mechanics language model, MeLM, applied to
solve various nonlinear forward and inverse problems, that can deal with a set
of instructions, numbers and microstructure data. The framework is applied to
various examples including bio-inspired hierarchical honeycomb design, carbon
nanotube mechanics, and protein unfolding. In spite of the flexible nature of
the model-which allows us to easily incorporate diverse materials, scales, and
mechanical features-it performs well across disparate forward and inverse
tasks. Based on an autoregressive attention-model, MeLM effectively represents
a large multi-particle system consisting of hundreds of millions of neurons,
where the interaction potentials are discovered through graph-forming
self-attention mechanisms that are then used to identify relationships from
emergent structures, while taking advantage of synergies discovered in the
training data. We show that the model can solve complex degenerate mechanics
design problems and determine novel material architectures across a range of
hierarchical levels, providing an avenue for materials discovery and analysis.
Looking beyond the demonstrations reported in this paper, we discuss other
opportunities in applied mechanics and general considerations about the use of
large language models in modeling, design, and analysis that can span a broad
spectrum of material properties from mechanical, thermal, optical, to
electronic.</p>

          <p>The sustainable development of next-generation device technology is paramount
in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts
have been made in the discovery and design of nanomaterials that achieve
device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy
cost are prioritized. However, many of such materials are composed of elements
that are under threat of depletion and pose elevated risks to the environment.
The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts
remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals
materials screening framework imbued with sustainability-motivated search
criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging
materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and
ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework
results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks
elements. Our findings constitute a critical first-step towards reinventing a
more sustainable electronics landscape beyond silicon, with the framework
established in this work serving as a harbinger of sustainable 2D materials

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Photovoltaics (PV) is the most important energy conversion technology for
cost-efficient climate change mitigation. To reach the international climate
goals, the annual PV module production capacity must be expanded to
multi-terawatt scale. Economic and resource constraints demand the
implementation cost-efficient multi-junction technologies, for which
perovskite-based tandem technologies are highly promising. In this work, the
resource demand of the emerging perovskite PV technology is investigated,
considering two factors of supply criticality, namely mining capacity for
minerals, as well as production capacity for synthetic materials. Overall, the
expansion of perovskite PV to a multi-terawatt scale may not be limited by
material supply if certain materials, especially cesium and indium, can be
replaced. Moreover, organic charge transport materials face unresolved
scalability challenges. This study demonstrates that, besides the improvement
of efficiency and stability, perovskite PV research needs also to be guided by
sustainable materials choices and design-for-recycling considerations.</p>

          <p>Cool a piece of the Sun to 1000 K at one millibar pressure to yield a mineral
assemblage consistent with those found in the most primitive meteorites. This
is an equilibrium or fractional condensation experiment simulated by
calculations using equations of state for hundreds of gaseous molecules,
condensed mineral solids, and silicate liquids, the products of a century of
experimental measurements and theoretical studies. Such calculations have
revolutionized our understanding of the chemistry of the cosmos.
  The mid-20th Century realization that meteorites are fossil records of the
early Solar System made chemistry central to understanding planetary origins.
Thus "condensation", the distribution of elements and isotopes between vapor
and condensed solids and/or liquids at or approaching chemical equilibrium,
deeply informs discussion of how meteor/comet compositions bear on planets.
  Condensation calculations have been applied to disks around young stars, to
the mineral "rain" of mineral grains expected to form in cool dwarf star
atmospheres, to the expanding envelopes of giant stars, to the vapor plumes
that form in planetary impacts, and to the chemically and isotopically distinct
"shells" computed and observed to exist in supernovae. As with all
sophisticated calculations, there are inherent caveats, subtleties, and
computational difficulties.
  Local chemistry has yet to be consistently integrated into dynamical
astrophysical simulations so that effects like the blocking of radiation by
grains, absorption and reemission of light by grains, and buffering of heat by
grain evaporation/condensation feed back into the physics at each node of a
gridded calculation over time. A deeper integration of thermochemistry with
physical models makes the prospect of a general protoplanetary disk model as
hopeful now as a general circulation model for global climate was in the early
1970's.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a thermodynamic model for subsolidus equilibria in the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2, which is relevant to the study of chondrites and the formation of planets.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in the field of thermodynamic modeling for subsolidus equilibria was limited by the use of simplifying assumptions and the lack of experimental data to validate the models. This paper improves upon the previous work by incorporating more realistic models for the Gibbs free energy and entropy, as well as using experimental data to validate the model.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the thermodynamic properties of the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system at different temperatures and compositions. These experiments included differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetry, and calorimetry.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the thermodynamic properties of the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system. Table 2 is also referenced frequently, as it provides a summary of the experimental data used to validate the model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is Wood (1963), which is mentioned throughout the paper as a seminal work in the field of chondrite formation and evolution. The reference is cited in the context of providing background information on the formation of chondrites and the relevance of the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system to this process.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of subsolidus equilibria in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system, which is relevant to the formation of chondrites and planets. The paper also demonstrates the importance of using experimental data to validate thermodynamic models, which could have implications for other fields of study as well.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simplifying assumptions and approximations, such as the use of a linear equation to represent the Gibbs free energy and entropy. While these assumptions may be reasonable for the specific system studied here, they may not hold true for more complex systems or under different conditions. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their model is limited to temperatures below 1000°C, which means that it may not be applicable to higher temperature regimes.</p>
