          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of
discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural
sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural
phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new
area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging
research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly
interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field
is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough
account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and
continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the
subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,
materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales
and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on
these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby
allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to
capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by
deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of
techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss
other common technical challenges, including explainability,
out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and
large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning
and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be
useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may
trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A lower-than-solar elemental nitrogen content has been demonstrated for
several comets, including 1P/Halley and 67P/C-G with independent in situ
measurements of volatile and refractory budgets. The recently discovered
semi-refractory ammonium salts in 67P/C-G are thought to be the missing
nitrogen reservoir in comets. The thermal desorption of ammonium salts from
cometary dust particles leads to their decomposition into ammonia and a
corresponding acid. The NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is expected to increase with
decreasing heliocentric distance with evidence for this in near-infrared
observations. NH$_{3}$ has been claimed to be more extended than expected for a
nuclear source. Here, the aim is to constrain the NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio in
comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) during its July 2020 passage. OH emission from comet
C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was monitored for 2 months with NRT and observed from GBT
on 24 July and 11 August 2020. Contemporaneously with the 24 July 2020 OH
observations, the NH$_{3}$ hyperfine lines were targeted with GBT. The
concurrent GBT and NRT observations allowed the OH quenching radius to be
determined at $\left(5.96\pm0.10\right)\times10^{4}$ km on 24 July 2020, which
is important for accurately deriving $Q(\text{OH})$. C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was a
highly active comet with $Q(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}) \approx 2\times10^{30}$ molec
s$^{-1}$ one day before perihelion. The $3\sigma$ upper limit for
$Q_{\text{NH}_{3}}/Q_{\text{H}_{2}\text{O}}$ is $<0.29\%$ at $0.7$ au from the
Sun. The obtained NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is a factor of a few lower than
measurements for other comets at such heliocentric distances. The abundance of
NH$_{3}$ may vary strongly with time depending on the amount of water-poor dust
in the coma. Lifted dust can be heated, fragmented, and super-heated; whereby,
ammonium salts, if present, can rapidly thermally disintegrate and modify the
NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio.</p>

A: The paper aims to determine the seasonal variation in the composition and physical properties of the comet 67P/C-G, specifically focusing on the pre-perihelion, perihelion, and post-perihelion periods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies had provided limited information on the composition and physical properties of comets, with little to no data available for specific seasons or periods within a comet's orbit. This paper improved upon the previous state of the art by providing a more detailed understanding of the seasonal variation in 67P/C-G through the analysis of data collected during Rosetta's mission to the comet.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper presents results from the MIRO and ROSINA instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft, which were used to measure the composition and physical properties of 67P/C-G during its perihelion passage in August 2015.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 4, as well as Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. These provide a visual representation of the seasonal variation in the composition and physical properties of 67P/C-G during its pre-perihelion, perihelion, and post-perihelion periods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference by Läuter et al. (2022) was cited the most frequently, as it provides additional information on the seasonal variation in cometary activity.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The understanding of planet formation has changed recently, embracing the new
idea of pebble accretion. This means that the influx of pebbles from the outer
regions of planet-forming disks to their inner zones could determine the
composition of planets and their atmospheres. The solid and molecular
components delivered to the planet-forming region can be best characterized by
mid-infrared spectroscopy. With Spitzer low-resolution (R=100, 600)
spectroscopy, this approach was limited to the detection of abundant molecules
such as H2O, C2H2, HCN and CO2. This contribution will present first results of
the MINDS (MIRI mid-IR Disk Survey, PI: Th. Henning) project. Due do the
sensitivity and spectral resolution (R~1500-3500) provided by JWST we now have
a unique tool to obtain the full inventory of chemistry in the inner disks of
solar-types stars and brown dwarfs, including also less abundant hydrocarbons
and isotopologues. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) capabilities enable at the
same time spatial studies of the continuum and line emission in extended
sources such as debris disks, the flying saucer and also the search for mid-IR
signatures of forming planets in systems such as PDS70. These JWST observations
are complementary to ALMA and NOEMA observations of the outer disk chemistry;
together these datasets provide an integral view of the processes occurring
during the planet formation phase.</p>
