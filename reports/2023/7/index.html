          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of
discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural
sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural
phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new
area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging
research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly
interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field
is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough
account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and
continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the
subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,
materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales
and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on
these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby
allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to
capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by
deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of
techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss
other common technical challenges, including explainability,
out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and
large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning
and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be
useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may
trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A lower-than-solar elemental nitrogen content has been demonstrated for
several comets, including 1P/Halley and 67P/C-G with independent in situ
measurements of volatile and refractory budgets. The recently discovered
semi-refractory ammonium salts in 67P/C-G are thought to be the missing
nitrogen reservoir in comets. The thermal desorption of ammonium salts from
cometary dust particles leads to their decomposition into ammonia and a
corresponding acid. The NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is expected to increase with
decreasing heliocentric distance with evidence for this in near-infrared
observations. NH$_{3}$ has been claimed to be more extended than expected for a
nuclear source. Here, the aim is to constrain the NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio in
comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) during its July 2020 passage. OH emission from comet
C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was monitored for 2 months with NRT and observed from GBT
on 24 July and 11 August 2020. Contemporaneously with the 24 July 2020 OH
observations, the NH$_{3}$ hyperfine lines were targeted with GBT. The
concurrent GBT and NRT observations allowed the OH quenching radius to be
determined at $\left(5.96\pm0.10\right)\times10^{4}$ km on 24 July 2020, which
is important for accurately deriving $Q(\text{OH})$. C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was a
highly active comet with $Q(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}) \approx 2\times10^{30}$ molec
s$^{-1}$ one day before perihelion. The $3\sigma$ upper limit for
$Q_{\text{NH}_{3}}/Q_{\text{H}_{2}\text{O}}$ is $<0.29\%$ at $0.7$ au from the
Sun. The obtained NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is a factor of a few lower than
measurements for other comets at such heliocentric distances. The abundance of
NH$_{3}$ may vary strongly with time depending on the amount of water-poor dust
in the coma. Lifted dust can be heated, fragmented, and super-heated; whereby,
ammonium salts, if present, can rapidly thermally disintegrate and modify the
NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The understanding of planet formation has changed recently, embracing the new
idea of pebble accretion. This means that the influx of pebbles from the outer
regions of planet-forming disks to their inner zones could determine the
composition of planets and their atmospheres. The solid and molecular
components delivered to the planet-forming region can be best characterized by
mid-infrared spectroscopy. With Spitzer low-resolution (R=100, 600)
spectroscopy, this approach was limited to the detection of abundant molecules
such as H2O, C2H2, HCN and CO2. This contribution will present first results of
the MINDS (MIRI mid-IR Disk Survey, PI: Th. Henning) project. Due do the
sensitivity and spectral resolution (R~1500-3500) provided by JWST we now have
a unique tool to obtain the full inventory of chemistry in the inner disks of
solar-types stars and brown dwarfs, including also less abundant hydrocarbons
and isotopologues. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) capabilities enable at the
same time spatial studies of the continuum and line emission in extended
sources such as debris disks, the flying saucer and also the search for mid-IR
signatures of forming planets in systems such as PDS70. These JWST observations
are complementary to ALMA and NOEMA observations of the outer disk chemistry;
together these datasets provide an integral view of the processes occurring
during the planet formation phase.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (ML-IAPs) enable quantum-accurate,
classical molecular dynamics simulations of large systems, beyond reach of
density functional theory (DFT). Yet, their efficiency and ability to predict
systems larger than DFT supercells are not fully explored, posing a question
regarding transferability to large-scale simulations with defects (e.g.
dislocations, cracks). Here, we apply a three-step validation approach to
body-centered-cubic iron. First, accuracy and efficiency are assessed by
optimizing ML-IAPs based on four state-of-the-art ML packages. The Pareto front
of computational speed versus testing root-mean-square-error (RMSE) is
computed. Second, benchmark properties relevant to plasticity and fracture are
evaluated. Their average relative error Q with respect to DFT is found to
correlate with RMSE. Third, transferability of ML-IAPs to dislocations and
cracks is investigated by using per-atom model uncertainty quantification. The
core structures and Peierls barriers of screw, M111 and three edge dislocations
are compared with DFT. Traction-separation curve and critical stress intensity
factor (K_Ic) are also predicted. Cleavage on the pre-existing crack plane is
found to be the zero-temperature atomistic fracture mechanism of pure
body-centered-cubic iron under mode-I loading, independent of ML package and
training database. Quantitative predictions of dislocation glide paths and KIc
can be sensitive to database, ML package, cutoff radius, and are limited by DFT
accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of validating ML-IAPs by using
indicators beyond RMSE. Moreover, significant computational speed-ups can be
achieved by using the most efficient ML-IAP package, yet the assessment of the
accuracy and transferability should be performed with care.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Modern battery materials can contain many elements with substantial site
disorder, and their configurational state has been shown to be critical for
their performance. The intercalation voltage profile is a critical parameter to
evaluate the performance of energy storage. The application of commonly used
cluster expansion techniques to model the intercalation thermodynamics of such
systems from \textit{ab-initio} is challenged by the combinatorial increase in
configurational degrees of freedom as the number of species grows. Such
challenges necessitate efficient generation of lattice models without
over-fitting and proper sampling of the configurational space under charge
balance in ionic systems. In this work, we introduce a combined approach that
addresses these challenges by (1) constructing a robust cluster-expansion
Hamiltonian using the sparse regression technique, including
$\ell_0\ell_2$-norm regularization and structural hierarchy; and (2)
implementing semigrand-canonical Monte Carlo to sample charge-balanced ionic
configurations using the table-exchange method and an ensemble-average
approach. These techniques are applied to a disordered rocksalt oxyfluoride
Li$_{1.3-x}$Mn$_{0.4}$Nb$_{0.3}$O$_{1.6}$F$_{0.4}$ (LMNOF) which is part of a
family of promising earth-abundant cathode materials. The simulated voltage
profile is found to be in good agreement with experimental data and
particularly provides a clear demonstration of the Mn and oxygen contribution
to the redox potential as a function of Li content.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Soft clay-like Li-superionic conductors have been recently synthesized by
mixing rigid-salts. Through computational and experimental analysis, we clarify
how a soft clay-like material can be created from a mixture of rigid-salts.
Using molecular dynamics simulations with a deep learning-based interatomic
potential energy model, we uncover the microscopic features responsible for
soft clay-formation from ionic solid mixtures. We find that salt mixtures
capable of forming molecular solid units on anion exchange, along with the slow
kinetics of such reactions, are key to soft-clay formation. Molecular solid
units serve as sites for shear transformation zones, and their inherent
softness enables plasticity at low stress. Extended X-ray absorption fine
structure spectroscopy confirms the formation of molecular solid units. A
general strategy for creating soft clay-like materials from ionic solid
mixtures is formulated.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Li$_2$S-P$_2$S$_5$ pseudo-binary system has been a valuable source of
promising superionic conductors, with $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$,
$\beta$-Li$_3$PS$_4$, HT-Li$_7$PS$_6$, and Li$_7$P$_3$S$_{11}$ having excellent
room temperature Li-ion conductivity > 0.1 mS/cm. The metastability of these
phases at ambient temperature motivates a study to quantify thermodynamic
accessibility. Through calculating the electronic, configurational, and
vibrational sources of free energy from first principles, a phase diagram of
the crystalline Li$_2$S-P$_2$S$_5$ space is constructed. Well-established phase
stability trends from experiments are recovered, such as polymorphic phase
transitions in Li$_7$PS$_6$ and Li$_3$PS$_4$, and the metastability of
Li$_7$P$_3$S$_{11}$ at high temperature. At ambient temperature, it is
predicted that all superionic conductors in this space are indeed metastable,
but thermodynamically accessible. Vibrational and configurational sources of
entropy are shown to be essential towards describing the stability of
superionic conductors. New details of the Li sublattices are revealed, and are
found to be crucial towards accurately predicting configurational entropy. All
superionic conductors contain significant configurational entropy, which
suggests an inherent correlation between superionic conductivity and high
configurational entropy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Blood vessel segmentation in medical imaging is one of the essential steps
for vascular disease diagnosis and interventional planning in a broad spectrum
of clinical scenarios in image-based medicine and interventional medicine.
Unfortunately, manual annotation of the vessel masks is challenging and
resource-intensive due to subtle branches and complex structures. To overcome
this issue, this paper presents a self-supervised vessel segmentation method,
dubbed the contrastive diffusion adversarial representation learning (C-DARL)
model. Our model is composed of a diffusion module and a generation module that
learns the distribution of multi-domain blood vessel data by generating
synthetic vessel images from diffusion latent. Moreover, we employ contrastive
learning through a mask-based contrastive loss so that the model can learn more
realistic vessel representations. To validate the efficacy, C-DARL is trained
using various vessel datasets, including coronary angiograms, abdominal digital
subtraction angiograms, and retinal imaging. Experimental results confirm that
our model achieves performance improvement over baseline methods with noise
robustness, suggesting the effectiveness of C-DARL for vessel segmentation.</p>

          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable the accurate
simulation of materials at larger sizes and time scales, and play increasingly
important roles in the computational understanding and design of materials.
However, MLIPs are only as accurate and robust as the data they are trained on.
In this work, we present DImensionality-Reduced Encoded Clusters with
sTratified (DIRECT) sampling as an approach to select a robust training set of
structures from a large and complex configuration space. By applying DIRECT
sampling on the Materials Project relaxation trajectories dataset with over one
million structures and 89 elements, we develop an improved materials 3-body
graph network (M3GNet) universal potential that extrapolate more reliably to
unseen structures. We further show that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
with universal potentials such as M3GNet can be used in place of expensive
\textit{ab initio} MD to rapidly create a large configuration space for target
materials systems. Combined with DIRECT sampling, we develop a highly reliable
moment tensor potential for Ti-H system without the need for iterative
optimization. This work paves the way towards robust high throughput
development of MLIPs across any compositional complexity.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign has been carried out to probe
stellar activity and variability in the young Sun-like star $\iota$-Horologii.
We present the results from long-term spectropolarimetric monitoring of the
system by using the ultra-stable spectropolarimeter/velocimeter HARPS at the
ESO 3.6-m telescope. Additionally, we included high-precision photometry from
the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and observations in the
far- and near-ultraviolet spectral regions using the STIS instrument on the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The high-quality dataset allows a robust
characterisation of the star's rotation period, as well as a probe of the
variability using a range of spectroscopic and photometric activity proxies. By
analyzing the gradient of the power spectra (GPS) of the TESS lightcurves we
constrained the faculae-to-spot driver ratio ($\rm S_{fac}/S_{spot}$) to
0.510$\pm$0.023, which indicates that the stellar surface is spot dominated
during the time of the observations. We compared the photospheric activity
properties derived from the GPS method with a magnetic field map of the star
derived using Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) from simultaneous
spectropolarimetric data for the first time. Different stellar activity proxies
enable a more complete interpretation of the observed variability. For example,
we observed enhanced emission in the HST transition line diagnostics C IV and C
III, suggesting a flaring event. From the analysis of TESS data acquired
simultaneously with the HST data, we investigate the photometric variability at
the precise moment that the emission increased and derive correlations between
different observables, probing the star from its photosphere to its corona.</p>
