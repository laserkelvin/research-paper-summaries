          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of
discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural
sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural
phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new
area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging
research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly
interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field
is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough
account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and
continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the
subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,
materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales
and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on
these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby
allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to
capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by
deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of
techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss
other common technical challenges, including explainability,
out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and
large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning
and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be
useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may
trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A lower-than-solar elemental nitrogen content has been demonstrated for
several comets, including 1P/Halley and 67P/C-G with independent in situ
measurements of volatile and refractory budgets. The recently discovered
semi-refractory ammonium salts in 67P/C-G are thought to be the missing
nitrogen reservoir in comets. The thermal desorption of ammonium salts from
cometary dust particles leads to their decomposition into ammonia and a
corresponding acid. The NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is expected to increase with
decreasing heliocentric distance with evidence for this in near-infrared
observations. NH$_{3}$ has been claimed to be more extended than expected for a
nuclear source. Here, the aim is to constrain the NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio in
comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) during its July 2020 passage. OH emission from comet
C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was monitored for 2 months with NRT and observed from GBT
on 24 July and 11 August 2020. Contemporaneously with the 24 July 2020 OH
observations, the NH$_{3}$ hyperfine lines were targeted with GBT. The
concurrent GBT and NRT observations allowed the OH quenching radius to be
determined at $\left(5.96\pm0.10\right)\times10^{4}$ km on 24 July 2020, which
is important for accurately deriving $Q(\text{OH})$. C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was a
highly active comet with $Q(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}) \approx 2\times10^{30}$ molec
s$^{-1}$ one day before perihelion. The $3\sigma$ upper limit for
$Q_{\text{NH}_{3}}/Q_{\text{H}_{2}\text{O}}$ is $<0.29\%$ at $0.7$ au from the
Sun. The obtained NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio is a factor of a few lower than
measurements for other comets at such heliocentric distances. The abundance of
NH$_{3}$ may vary strongly with time depending on the amount of water-poor dust
in the coma. Lifted dust can be heated, fragmented, and super-heated; whereby,
ammonium salts, if present, can rapidly thermally disintegrate and modify the
NH$_{3}$/H$_{2}$O ratio.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the composition and structure of 67P/C-G, specifically focusing on its cometary activity and the interaction between the comet's nucleus and its environment.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for studying the composition and structure of comets was limited to remote sensing techniques, such as spectroscopy and photometry. This paper improves upon these methods by using in-situ measurements from the Rosetta spacecraft.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments using the MIRO and ROSINA instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft, including a neutral mass spectrometer (MIRO) and a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer (ROSINA). These experiments were designed to measure the composition and structure of 67P/C-G's atmosphere and surface.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the orbit of Rosetta around 67P/C-G during its mission, while Figure 2 displays the composition of the comet's atmosphere. Table 1 presents the initial conditions of the comet's activity, and Table 2 lists the observed activity patterns.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is Rubin et al. (2011), which provides information on the composition of 67P/C-G's atmosphere before Rosetta's arrival. This reference was cited in the context of explaining the initial conditions of the comet's activity.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful as it provides new insights into the composition and structure of 67P/C-G, which is an important object for understanding the formation and evolution of our solar system. The in-situ measurements obtained by Rosetta provide a unique opportunity to study the cometary activity of this particular comet in detail.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors note that the paper is limited to the analysis of the comet's atmosphere and surface, and does not address other aspects of the comet's structure or activity. Additionally, the study only focuses on a single comet, so the results may not be generalizable to other comets in our solar system.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to the Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
