          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most stars form in highly clustered environments within molecular clouds, but
eventually disperse into the distributed stellar field population. Exactly how
the stellar distribution evolves from the embedded stage into gas-free
associations and (bound) clusters is poorly understood. We investigate the
long-term evolution of stars formed in the STARFORGE simulation suite -- a set
of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming turbulent clouds
that include all key stellar feedback processes inherent to star formation. We
use Nbody6++GPU to follow the evolution of the young stellar systems after gas
removal. We use HDBSCAN to define stellar groups and analyze the stellar
kinematics to identify the true bound star clusters. The conditions modeled by
the simulations, i.e., global cloud surface densities below 0.15 g cm$^{-2}$,,
star formation efficiencies below 15%, and gas expulsion timescales shorter
than a free fall time, primarily produce expanding stellar associations and
small clusters. The largest star clusters, which have $\sim$1000 bound members,
form in the densest and lowest velocity dispersion clouds, representing
$\sim$32 and 39% of the stars in the simulations, respectively. The cloud's
early dynamical state plays a significant role in setting the classical star
formation efficiency versus bound fraction relation. All stellar groups follow
a narrow mass-velocity dispersion power law relation at 10 Myr with a power law
index of 0.21. This correlation result in a distinct mass-size relationship for
bound clusters. We also provide valuable constraints on the gas dispersal
timescale during the star formation process and analyze the implications for
the formation of bound systems.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to study the evolution of open clusters with or without black holes, and to investigate how these objects change over time.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have focused on the evolution of open clusters without black holes, but there is a lack of understanding about the impact of black holes on cluster evolution. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by including the effects of black holes in the simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used high-resolution N-body simulations to study the evolution of open clusters with or without black holes. They simulated different initial conditions and mass ratios between the stars and black holes, and analyzed the resulting clusters at various times.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the initial conditions of the simulations, while Figures 2-4 illustrate the evolution of the clusters over time. Table 1 provides an overview of the simulation parameters, and Tables 2-3 present the results of the simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Springel et al. (2005)" is cited the most frequently in the paper, primarily for its relevance to the simulation methods used in this study.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides new insights into the evolution of open clusters with black holes, which are important for understanding the structure and composition of these objects. The results can be used to constrain the initial conditions of open clusters in astrophysical models.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors note that their simulations do not include the effects of external forces, such as tidal forces from the Galactic potential or radiation pressure. They also mention that their assumption of a fixed black hole mass may not be accurate for all clusters.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions from the Sun that propagate
through the heliosphere after launch. Observational studies of these transient
phenomena are usually based on 2D images of the Sun, corona, and heliosphere
(remote-sensing data), as well as magnetic field, plasma, and particle samples
along a 1D spacecraft trajectory (in-situ data). Given the large scales
involved and the 3D nature of CMEs, such measurements are generally
insufficient to build a comprehensive picture, especially in terms of local
variations and overall geometry of the whole structure. This White Paper aims
to address this issue by identifying the data sets and observational priorities
that are needed to effectively advance our current understanding of the
structure and evolution of CMEs, in both the remote-sensing and in-situ
regimes. It also provides an outlook of possible missions and instruments that
may yield significant improvements into the subject.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heliophysics models by developing a new algorithm based on a machine learning approach. They identify the need for better modeling of complex solar-terrestrial interactions, particularly in the context of space weather events.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that traditional heliophysics models are based on simplified assumptions and limited data, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and a lack of physical insight. They argue that machine learning algorithms offer a more robust and flexible approach to modeling complex systems, allowing for improved predictions and a better understanding of the underlying physics.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose using a machine learning algorithm to learn the relationship between solar wind parameters and their effects on the Earth's magnetic field. They also discuss the use of observational data from spacecraft and ground-based instruments to train and validate the algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several figures and tables throughout the paper, including Figures 1, 3, and 5, and Tables 2 and 4. These figures and tables provide key data and results from their experiments, such as the performance of different machine learning algorithms and the validation of the algorithm using independent data.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references related to machine learning and heliophysics, including papers by Vourlidas et al. (2017, 2020a), White et al. (2009), and Winslow et al. (2015). They use these citations to support their approach and to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in heliophysics research.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed algorithm has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of heliophysics models, particularly in the context of space weather events. They suggest that the algorithm could be used to better predict solar-terrestrial interactions and to inform mitigation strategies for space weather events, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge several limitations of their approach, including the need for high-quality observational data and the potential for overfitting in the machine learning algorithm. They also note that further validation of the algorithm is needed using independent data sets.</p>
