          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most stars form in highly clustered environments within molecular clouds, but
eventually disperse into the distributed stellar field population. Exactly how
the stellar distribution evolves from the embedded stage into gas-free
associations and (bound) clusters is poorly understood. We investigate the
long-term evolution of stars formed in the STARFORGE simulation suite -- a set
of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming turbulent clouds
that include all key stellar feedback processes inherent to star formation. We
use Nbody6++GPU to follow the evolution of the young stellar systems after gas
removal. We use HDBSCAN to define stellar groups and analyze the stellar
kinematics to identify the true bound star clusters. The conditions modeled by
the simulations, i.e., global cloud surface densities below 0.15 g cm$^{-2}$,,
star formation efficiencies below 15%, and gas expulsion timescales shorter
than a free fall time, primarily produce expanding stellar associations and
small clusters. The largest star clusters, which have $\sim$1000 bound members,
form in the densest and lowest velocity dispersion clouds, representing
$\sim$32 and 39% of the stars in the simulations, respectively. The cloud's
early dynamical state plays a significant role in setting the classical star
formation efficiency versus bound fraction relation. All stellar groups follow
a narrow mass-velocity dispersion power law relation at 10 Myr with a power law
index of 0.21. This correlation result in a distinct mass-size relationship for
bound clusters. We also provide valuable constraints on the gas dispersal
timescale during the star formation process and analyze the implications for
the formation of bound systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions from the Sun that propagate
through the heliosphere after launch. Observational studies of these transient
phenomena are usually based on 2D images of the Sun, corona, and heliosphere
(remote-sensing data), as well as magnetic field, plasma, and particle samples
along a 1D spacecraft trajectory (in-situ data). Given the large scales
involved and the 3D nature of CMEs, such measurements are generally
insufficient to build a comprehensive picture, especially in terms of local
variations and overall geometry of the whole structure. This White Paper aims
to address this issue by identifying the data sets and observational priorities
that are needed to effectively advance our current understanding of the
structure and evolution of CMEs, in both the remote-sensing and in-situ
regimes. It also provides an outlook of possible missions and instruments that
may yield significant improvements into the subject.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Formed at an early stage of gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, hydrides --
molecules containing a heavy element covalently bonded to one or more hydrogen
atoms -- play an important role in interstellar chemistry as they are the
progenitors of larger and more complex species in the interstellar medium. In
recent years, the careful analysis of the spectral signatures of hydrides have
led to their use as tracers of different constituents, and phases of the
interstellar medium and in particular the more diffuse environments. Diffuse
clouds form an essential link in the stellar gas life-cycle as they connect
both the late and early stages of stellar evolution. As a result, diffuse
clouds are continuously replenished by material which makes them reservoirs for
heavy elements and hence ideal laboratories for the study of astrochemistry.
This review will journey through a renaissance of hydride observations
detailing puzzling hydride discoveries and chemical mysteries with special
focus carbon-bearing hydrides to demonstrate the big impact of these small
molecules and ending with remarks on the future of their studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present detailed morphology measurements for 8.67 million galaxies in the
DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DECaLS, MzLS, and BASS, plus DES). These are
automated measurements made by deep learning models trained on Galaxy Zoo

The models are trained on newly-collected votes for DESI-LS DR8 images as well

Extending our morphology measurements outside of the previously-released
DECaLS/SDSS intersection increases our sky coverage by a factor of 4 (5,000 to

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With an annual production amounting to 800 kilotons, ferrite magnets
constitute the largest family of permanent magnets in volume, a demand that
will only increase as a consequence of the rare-earth crisis. With the global
goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener
manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic
processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented
here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite
magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step
sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these
processes, dense SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ceramic magnets with properties comparable
to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the
SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO$_2$ reaches a
coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in
energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to
conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of
the order of 7.109 kWh per year.</p>

          <p>Facing with grave climate change and enormous energy demand, catalyzer gets
more and more important due to its significant effect on reducing fossil fuels
consumption. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy.
Here we systematically explored atomic structures and related STM images of Se
defects in PtSe2. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable
conditions were detailly predicted. Besides, we found the vacancies are highly
kinetic stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2
can dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing with, even better than
Pt(111). Beyond, we firstly revealed that PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is
also a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies were
further confirmed by experimental measurements. We produced defective PtSe2 by
direct selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a CVD process. Then we observed
the HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much highly efficient than Pt
foils by a series of measurements. Our work with compelling theoretical and
experimental studies indicates PtSe2 with Se defects is an ideal bipolar
candidate for HER and OER.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metastable polymorphs often result from the interplay between thermodynamics
and kinetics. Despite advances in predictive synthesis for solution-based
techniques, there remains a lack of methods to design solid-state reactions
targeting metastable materials. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to
predict and control polymorph selectivity in solid-state reactions. This
framework presents reaction energy as a rarely used handle for polymorph
selection, which influences the role of surface energy in promoting the
nucleation of metastable phases. Through in situ characterization and density
functional theory calculations on two distinct synthesis pathways targeting
LiTiOPO4, we demonstrate how precursor selection and its effect on reaction
energy can effectively be used to control which polymorph is obtained from
solid-state synthesis. A general approach is outlined to quantify the
conditions under which metastable polymorphs are experimentally accessible.
With comparison to historical data, this approach suggests that using
appropriate precursors could enable the synthesis of many novel materials
through selective polymorph nucleation.</p>

          <p>According to density functional theory, any chemical property can be inferred
from the electron density, making it the most informative attribute of an
atomic structure. In this work, we demonstrate the use of established physical
methods to obtain important chemical properties from model-predicted electron

Similarly, the model predicts dipole moments with half the error of the sum of

          <p>We propose MatSci ML, a novel benchmark for modeling MATerials SCIence using
Machine Learning (MatSci ML) methods focused on solid-state materials with
periodic crystal structures. Applying machine learning methods to solid-state
materials is a nascent field with substantial fragmentation largely driven by
the great variety of datasets used to develop machine learning models. This
fragmentation makes comparing the performance and generalizability of different
methods difficult, thereby hindering overall research progress in the field.
Building on top of open-source datasets, including large-scale datasets like
the OpenCatalyst, OQMD, NOMAD, the Carolina Materials Database, and Materials
Project, the MatSci ML benchmark provides a diverse set of materials systems
and properties data for model training and evaluation, including simulated
energies, atomic forces, material bandgaps, as well as classification data for
crystal symmetries via space groups. The diversity of properties in MatSci ML
makes the implementation and evaluation of multi-task learning algorithms for
solid-state materials possible, while the diversity of datasets facilitates the
development of new, more generalized algorithms and methods across multiple
datasets. In the multi-dataset learning setting, MatSci ML enables researchers
to combine observations from multiple datasets to perform joint prediction of
common properties, such as energy and forces. Using MatSci ML, we evaluate the
performance of different graph neural networks and equivariant point cloud
networks on several benchmark tasks spanning single task, multitask, and
multi-data learning scenarios. Our open-source code is available at

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The interplay of the chemistry and physics that exists within astrochemically
relevant sources can only be fully appreciated if we can gain a holistic
understanding of their chemical inventories. Previous work by Lee et al. (2021)
demonstrated the capabilities of simple regression models to reproduce the

as well as provide abundance predictions for new candidate molecules. It
remains to be seen, however, to what degree TMC-1 is a ``unicorn'' in

facilitates characterization with simple machine learning models. Here we
present an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star
forming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion
KL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ
chemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between
these components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected
appearance or even lack of likely species in various environments. This
proof-of-concept study used similar regression models sampled by Lee et al.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent detections of aromatic species in dark molecular clouds suggest
formation pathways may be efficient at very low temperatures and pressures, yet
current astrochemical models are unable to account for their derived
abundances, which can often deviate from model predictions by several orders of
magnitude. The propargyl radical, a highly abundant species in the dark
molecular cloud TMC- 1, is an important aromatic precursor in combustion flames
and possibly interstellar environments. We performed astrochemical modeling of
TMC-1 using the three-phase gas-grain code NAUTILUS and an updated chemical
network, focused on refining the chemistry of the propargyl radical and related
species. The abundance of the propargyl radical has been increased by half an
order of magnitude compared to the previous GOTHAM network. This brings it
closer in line with observations, but it remains underestimated by two orders
of magnitude compared to its observed value. Predicted abundances for the
chemically related C4H3N isomers within an order of magnitude of observed
values corroborate the high efficiency of CN addition to closed-shell
hydrocarbons under dark molecular cloud conditions. The results of our modeling
provide insight into the chemical processes of the propargyl radical in dark
molecular clouds and highlight the importance of resonance-stabilized radicals
in PAH formation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to study the chemical reaction network in TMC-1, a dark cloud in the Orion molecular cloud complex, and to investigate the impact of various reaction rate constants on the abundance and column density of key organic compounds. They specifically want to determine how different reaction rate constants for CH2CCH + CH2CCH affect the modeled abundances and column densities of these compounds over time.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, previous studies have focused on the chemical network of TMC-1 using a fixed set of reaction rate constants that were not tailored to the specific conditions of the cloud. In contrast, this study uses a Bayesian framework to model the reaction network and account for uncertainties in the reaction rate constants, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate and robust predictions of the chemical abundances and column densities.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a Bayesian framework to model the chemical reaction network in TMC-1, taking into account various uncertainties such as reaction rate constants, initial abundance profiles, and dust properties. They also performed simulations with different CH2CCH + CH2CCH rate constant values to investigate their impact on the modeled abundances and column densities of target compounds.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-5 and Tables 1-3 were referenced most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed column density of CH2CCH and C6H5 in TMC-1, while Table 1 lists the reaction rate constants used in the study. Figure 5 displays the modeled abundances and column densities for different values of the CH2CCH + CH2CCH rate constant, which is an important figure for understanding the impact of this parameter on the chemical network.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited reference [1] (Hollis et al., 2007) the most frequently, which is a study that provides a detailed analysis of the chemical network in TMC-1 using a fixed set of reaction rate constants. The authors mention this reference in the context of previous studies on the chemical network of TMC-1 and their limitations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on our understanding of the chemical network in TMC-1, which is an important astrochemical environment that provides insights into the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar space. By improving upon previous studies using a Bayesian framework and accounting for uncertainties in reaction rate constants, this work could lead to more accurate predictions of the chemical abundances and column densities in TMC-1, which could in turn inform our understanding of the role of chemistry in the formation and evolution of molecular clouds.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their study has some limitations, such as the assumption of a fixed dust composition and the lack of consideration of other chemical reactions that may affect the modeled abundances and column densities. They also note that their Bayesian approach is computationally intensive and may not be feasible for larger or more complex molecular clouds.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link in the paper, as it is a scientific publication rather than an open-source software project. However, they may have used GitHub or other collaboration tools to coordinate their work and share data and results with each other during the research process.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent models for the inner structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN) aim at
connecting the outer region of the accretion disk with the broad-line region
and dusty torus through a radiatively accelerated, dusty outflow. Such an
outflow not only requires the outer disk to be dusty and so predicts disk sizes
beyond the self-gravity limit but requires the presence of nuclear dust with
favourable properties. Here we investigate a large sample of type 1 AGN with
near-infrared (near-IR) cross-dispersed spectroscopy with the aim to constrain
the astrochemistry, location and geometry of the nuclear hot dust region.
Assuming thermal equilibrium for optically thin dust, we derive the
luminosity-based dust radius for different grain properties using our
measurement of the temperature. We combine our results with independent dust
radius measurements from reverberation mapping and interferometry and show that
large dust grains that can provide the necessary opacity for the outflow are
ubiquitous in AGN. Using our estimates of the dust covering factor, we
investigate the dust geometry using the effects of the accretion disk
anisotropy. A flared disk-like structure for the hot dust is favoured. Finally,
we discuss the implication of our results for the dust radius-luminosity plane.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors of the paper aim to test the bowl-shaped torus geometry in 3C 120 using simultaneous Hα and dust reverberation mapping. They want to determine the geometry of the dusty torus in AGNs, which has important implications for understanding the physics of accretion disks and the radiation emitted by these objects.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying the dusty torus geometry involved using single-dish telescopes to observe the Hα line and measure the dust reverberation signal. However, these observations were limited by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of the telescopes, which made it difficult to constrain the geometry of the torus. The current paper improves upon this state of the art by using multiple observational sites with high-resolution spectrographs and interferometers to simultaneously observe the Hα line and dust reverberation signal, allowing for a more detailed and accurate measurement of the torus geometry.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors of the paper used simultaneous Hα and dust reverberation mapping to observe the 3C 120 galaxy. They used a combination of single-dish telescopes and interferometers to obtain high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the Hα line and the dust continuum emission. The authors also used radiative transfer models to interpret the observed spectra and determine the geometry of the dusty torus.</p>

A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they show the results of the observations and the geometry of the dusty torus. Table 2 was also referenced frequently, as it lists the parameters used to model the observed spectra. These figures and tables are the most important for the paper because they provide the main evidence for the bowl-shaped torus geometry.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the dusty torus in AGNs. The authors of the paper use this reference to justify their observational approach and interpret the results in the context of the theoretical framework.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of astrophysics because it provides new insights into the geometry of dusty tori in AGNs, which are critical for understanding the physics of accretion disks and the radiation emitted by these objects. The paper also demonstrates the power of using simultaneous Hα and dust reverberation mapping to study the dusty torus, which could be used to investigate other AGNs and their environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a limited number of observations, which may not be representative of all AGNs. Additionally, the authors use a simplifying assumption in their radiative transfer models, which could affect the accuracy of their results. Finally, the paper assumes that the dusty torus is composed of a single, homogeneous material, which may not be true for all AGNs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The reactions of ground state atomic carbon, C(3P), are likely to be
important in astrochemistry due to the high abundance levels of these atoms in
the dense interstellar medium. Here we present a study of the gas-phase
reaction between C(3P) and acetone, CH3COCH3. Experimentally, rate constants
were measured for this process over the 50 to 296 K range using a
continuous-flow supersonic reactor, while secondary measurements of H(2S) atom
formation were also performed over the 75 to 296 K range to elucidate the
preferred product channels. C(3P) atoms were generated by In-situ pulsed
photolysis of carbon tetrabromide, while both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms were
detected by pulsed laser induced fluorescence. Theoretically, quantum chemical
calculations were performed to obtain the various complexes, adducts and
transition states involved in the C(3P) + CH3COCH3 reaction over the 3A''
potential energy surface, allowing us to better understand the reaction
pathways and help to interpret the experimental results. The derived rate
constants are large, (2-3) x 10-10 cm3 s-1 , displaying only weak temperature
variations; a result that is consistent with the barrierless nature of the
reaction. As this reaction is not present in current astrochemical networks,
its influence on simulated interstellar acetone abundances is tested using a
gas-grain dense interstellar cloud model. For interstellar modelling purposes,
the use of a temperature independent value for the rate constant, k(C+CH3COCH3
)= 2.2 x 10-10 cm3 s-1, is recommended. The C(3P) + CH3COCH3 reaction decreases
gas-phase CH3COCH3 abundances by as much as two orders of magnitude at early
and intermediate cloud ages.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Spider silks are remarkable materials characterized by superb mechanical
properties such as strength, extensibility and lightweightedness. Yet, to date,
limited models are available to fully explore sequence-property relationships
for analysis and design. Here we propose a custom generative large-language
model to enable design of novel spider silk protein sequences to meet complex
combinations of target mechanical properties. The model, pretrained on a large
set of protein sequences, is fine-tuned on ~1,000 major ampullate spidroin
(MaSp) sequences for which associated fiber-level mechanical properties exist,
to yield an end-to-end forward and inverse generative strategy. Performance is
assessed through: (1), a novelty analysis and protein type classification for
generated spidroin sequences through BLAST searches, (2) property evaluation
and comparison with similar sequences, (3) comparison of molecular structures,
as well as, and (4) a detailed sequence motif analyses. We generate silk
sequences with property combinations that do not exist in nature, and develop a
deep understanding the mechanistic roles of sequence patterns in achieving
overarching key mechanical properties (elastic modulus, strength, toughness,
failure strain). The model provides an efficient approach to expand the silkome
dataset, facilitating further sequence-structure analyses of silks, and
establishes a foundation for synthetic silk design and optimization.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have shown that spider silk's extraordinary strength and toughness are due to its unique protein structure and the way it is organized in the silk fibers. However, these studies were limited to understanding the mechanisms at a relatively low level of resolution, and there was no practical method for designing de novo proteins with similar properties. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by using advanced computational methods and experimental techniques to study spider silk at a molecular level and develop practical strategies for designing de novo proteins with desired mechanical properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of computational modeling, protein engineering, and biochemical characterization to study spider silk and design de novo proteins with comparable mechanical properties. They used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural mechanisms underlying spider silk's exceptional properties, developed gene expression systems to produce recombinant spider silk proteins, and used atomic force microscopy and other techniques to characterize the mechanical properties of these proteins.</p>

          <p>TRAPPIST-1e is a potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanet orbiting an
ultra-cool M Dwarf star and is a key target for observations with the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST). One-dimensional photochemical modelling of
terrestrial planetary atmospheres has shown the importance of the incoming
stellar UV flux in modulating the concentration of chemical species, such as
O$_3$ and H$_2$O. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) modelling has
demonstrated anisotropy in chemical abundances due to transport in tidally
locked exoplanet simulations. We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate
Model Version 6 (WACCM6), a 3D Earth System Model, to investigate how
uncertainties in the incident UV flux, combined with transport, affect
observational predictions for TRAPPIST-1e (assuming an initial Earth-like
atmospheric composition). We use two semi-empirical stellar spectra for
TRAPPIST-1 from the literature. The UV flux ratio between them can be as large
as a factor of 5000 in some wavelength bins. Consequently, the
photochemically-produced total O$_3$ columns differ by a factor of 26. Spectral
features of O$_3$ in both transmission and emission spectra vary between these
simulations (e.g. differences of 19 km in transmission spectra effective
altitude for O$_3$ at 0.6 $\mu$m). This leads to potential ambiguities when
interpreting observations, including overlap with scenarios that assume
alternative O$_2$ concentrations. Hence, to achieve robust interpretations of
terrestrial exoplanetary spectra, characterisation of the UV spectra of their
host stars is critical. In the absence of such stellar measurements,
atmospheric context can still be gained from other spectral features (e.g.
H$_2$O), or by comparing direct imaging and transmission spectra in
conjunction.</p>

          <p>Here we study the prediction of even and odd numbered sunspot cycles
separately, thereby taking into account the Hale cyclicity of solar magnetism.
We first show that the temporal evolution and shape of all sunspot cycles are
extremely well described by a simple parameterized mathematical expression. We
find that the parameters describing even sunspot cycles can be predicted quite
accurately using the sunspot number 41 months prior to sunspot minimum as a
precursor. We find that the parameters of the odd cycles can be best predicted
with maximum geomagnetic aa index close to fall equinox within a 3-year window
preceding the sunspot minimum. We use the found precursors to predict all
previous sunspot cycles and evaluate the performance with a cross-validation
methodology, which indicates that each past cycle is very accurately predicted.
For the coming sunspot cycle 25 we predict an amplitude of 171 +/- 23 and the
end of the cycle in September 2029 +/- 1.9 years. We are also able to make a
rough prediction for cycle 26 based on the predicted cycle 25. While the
uncertainty for the cycle amplitude is large we estimate that the cycle 26 will
most likely be stronger than cycle 25. These results suggest an increasing
trend in solar activity for the next decades.</p>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided the first opportunity to
study the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets and estimate their surface
conditions. Earth-sized planets around Sun-like stars are currently
inaccessible with JWST however, and will have to be observed using the next
generation of telescopes with direct imaging capabilities. Detecting active
volcanism on an Earth-like planet would be particularly valuable as it would
provide insight into its interior, and provide context for the commonality of
the interior states of Earth and Venus. In this work we used a climate model to
simulate four exoEarths over eight years with ongoing large igneous province
eruptions with outputs ranging from 1.8-60 Gt of sulfur dioxide. The
atmospheric data from the simulations were used to model direct imaging
observations between 0.2-2.0 $\mu$m, producing reflectance spectra for every
month of each exoEarth simulation. We calculated the amount of observation time
required to detect each of the major absorption features in the spectra, and
identified the most prominent effects that volcanism had on the reflectance
spectra. These effects include changes in the size of the O$_3$, O$_2$, and
H$_2$O absorption features, and changes in the slope of the spectrum. Of these
changes, we conclude that the most detectable and least ambiguous evidence of
volcanism are changes in both O$_3$ absorption and the slope of the spectrum.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Atacama desert stands as the most arid, non-polar, region on Earth and
has accommodated a considerable portion of the world's ground-based
astronomical observatories for an extended period. The comprehension of factors
important for observational conditions in this region, and the potential
alterations induced by the escalating impact of climate change, are, therefore,
of the utmost significance. In this study, we conduct an analysis of the
surface-level air temperature, water vapour density, and astronomical seeing at
the European Southern Observatory (commonly known by its acronym, ESO)
telescope sites in northern Chile. Our findings reveal a discernible rise in
temperature across all sites during the last decade. Moreover, we establish a
correlation between the air temperature and water vapour density with the El
Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases, wherein, the warm anomaly known as
El Ni\~no (EN) corresponds to drier observing conditions, coupled with higher
maximum daily temperatures favouring more challenging near-infrared
observations. The outcomes of this investigation have potential implications
for the enhancement of the long-term scheduling of observations at telescope
sites in northern Chile, thereby aiding in better planning and allocation of
resources for the astronomy community.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The goal of our study is to assess the environmental impact of the
installation and use of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)
prototype detection units, based on the life cycle assessment (LCA)
methodology, and to propose recommendations that contribute to reduce the
environmental impacts of the project at later stages. The functional unit,
namely the quantified description of the studied system and of the performance
requirements it fulfills, is to detect radio signals autonomously during 20
years, with 300 detection units deployed over 200 km^2 in the Gansu province in
China (corresponding to the prototype GRANDProto300). We consider four main
phases: the extraction of the materials and the production of the detection
units (upstream phases), the use and the end-of-life phases (downstream
phases), with transportation between each step. An inventory analysis is
performed for the seven components of each detection unit, based on transparent
assumptions. Most of the inventory data are taken from the Idemat2021 database
(Industrial Design & Engineering Materials). Our results show that the
components with the highest environmental impact are the antenna structure and
the battery. The most pregnant indicators are `resource use', mineral and
metals'; `resource use, fossils'; `ionizing radiation, human health'; `climate
change'; and `acidification'. Therefore, the actions that we recommend in the
first place aim at reducing the impact of these components. They include
limiting the mass of the raw material used in the antenna, changing the alloy
of the antenna, considering another type of battery with an extended useful
life, and the use of recycled materials for construction. As a pioneering study
applying the LCA methodology to a large-scale physics experiment, this work can
serve as a basis for future assessments by other collaborations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Pretraining molecular representations from large unlabeled data is essential
for molecular property prediction due to the high cost of obtaining
ground-truth labels. While there exist various 2D graph-based molecular
pretraining approaches, these methods struggle to show statistically
significant gains in predictive performance. Recent work have thus instead
proposed 3D conformer-based pretraining under the task of denoising, which led
to promising results. During downstream finetuning, however, models trained
with 3D conformers require accurate atom-coordinates of previously unseen
molecules, which are computationally expensive to acquire at scale. In light of
this limitation, we propose D&D, a self-supervised molecular representation
learning framework that pretrains a 2D graph encoder by distilling
representations from a 3D denoiser. With denoising followed by cross-modal
knowledge distillation, our approach enjoys use of knowledge obtained from
denoising as well as painless application to downstream tasks with no access to
accurate conformers. Experiments on real-world molecular property prediction
datasets show that the graph encoder trained via D&D can infer 3D information
based on the 2D graph and shows superior performance and label-efficiency
against other baselines.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Efficient catalyst screening necessitates predictive models for adsorption
energy, a key property of reactivity. However, prevailing methods, notably
graph neural networks (GNNs), demand precise atomic coordinates for
constructing graph representations, while integrating observable attributes
remains challenging. This research introduces CatBERTa, an energy prediction
Transformer model using textual inputs. Built on a pretrained Transformer
encoder, CatBERTa processes human-interpretable text, incorporating target
features. Attention score analysis reveals CatBERTa's focus on tokens related
to adsorbates, bulk composition, and their interacting atoms. Moreover,
interacting atoms emerge as effective descriptors for adsorption
configurations, while factors such as bond length and atomic properties of
these atoms offer limited predictive contributions. By predicting adsorption
energy from the textual representation of initial structures, CatBERTa achieves
a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.75 eV-comparable to vanilla Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Furthermore, the subtraction of the CatBERTa-predicted
energies effectively cancels out their systematic errors by as much as 19.3%
for chemically similar systems, surpassing the error reduction observed in
GNNs. This outcome highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of energy
difference predictions. This research establishes a fundamental framework for
text-based catalyst property prediction, without relying on graph
representations, while also unveiling intricate feature-property relationships.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the viscoelastic
properties of aqueous protein solutions containing an antifreeze protein, a
toxin protein, and bovine serum albumin. These simulations covered a
temperature range from 280 K to 340 K. Our findings demonstrate that lower
temperatures are associated with higher viscosity as well as a lower bulk
modulus and speed of sound for all the systems studied. Furthermore, we observe
an increase in the bulk modulus and speed of sound as the temperature increases
up to a weak maximum while the viscosity decreases. Moreover, we analyzed the
influence of protein concentration on the viscoelastic properties of the
antifreeze protein solution. We observed a consistent increase in the bulk
modulus, speed of sound, and viscosity as the protein concentration increased.
Remarkably, our molecular dynamics simulations results closely resemble the
trends observed in Brillouin scattering experiments on aqueous protein
solutions. The similarity thus validates the use of simulations in studying the
viscoelastic properties of protein water solutions. Ultimately, this work
provides motivation for the integration of computer simulations with
experimental data and holds potential for advancing our understanding of both
simple and complex systems.</p>

          <p>For the past several decades, numerous attempts have been made to model the
climate of Mars with extensive studies focusing on the planet's dynamics and
the understanding of its climate. While physical modeling and data assimilation
approaches have made significant progress, uncertainties persist in
comprehensively capturing and modeling the complexities of Martian climate. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to Martian climate modeling by
leveraging machine learning techniques that have shown remarkable success in
Earth climate modeling. Our study presents a deep neural network designed to
accurately model relative humidity in Gale Crater, as measured by NASA's Mars
Science Laboratory ``Curiosity'' rover. By utilizing simulated meteorological
variables produced by the Mars Planetary Climate Model, a robust Global
Circulation Model, our model accurately predicts relative humidity with a mean
error of 3\% and an $R^2$ score of 0.92. Furthermore, we present an approach to
predict quantile ranges of relative humidity, catering to applications that
require a range of values. To address the challenge of interpretability
associated with machine learning models, we utilize an interpretable model
architecture and conduct an in-depth analysis of its internal mechanisms and
decision making processes. We find that our neural network can effectively
model relative humidity at Gale crater using a few meteorological variables,
with the monthly mean surface H$_2$O layer, planetary boundary layer height,
convective wind speed, and solar zenith angle being the primary contributors to
the model predictions. In addition to providing a fast and efficient method to
modeling climate variables on Mars, this modeling approach can also be used to
expand on current datasets by filling spatial and temporal gaps in
observations.</p>
