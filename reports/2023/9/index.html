          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most stars form in highly clustered environments within molecular clouds, but
eventually disperse into the distributed stellar field population. Exactly how
the stellar distribution evolves from the embedded stage into gas-free
associations and (bound) clusters is poorly understood. We investigate the
long-term evolution of stars formed in the STARFORGE simulation suite -- a set
of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming turbulent clouds
that include all key stellar feedback processes inherent to star formation. We
use Nbody6++GPU to follow the evolution of the young stellar systems after gas
removal. We use HDBSCAN to define stellar groups and analyze the stellar
kinematics to identify the true bound star clusters. The conditions modeled by
the simulations, i.e., global cloud surface densities below 0.15 g cm$^{-2}$,,
star formation efficiencies below 15%, and gas expulsion timescales shorter
than a free fall time, primarily produce expanding stellar associations and
small clusters. The largest star clusters, which have $\sim$1000 bound members,
form in the densest and lowest velocity dispersion clouds, representing
$\sim$32 and 39% of the stars in the simulations, respectively. The cloud's
early dynamical state plays a significant role in setting the classical star
formation efficiency versus bound fraction relation. All stellar groups follow
a narrow mass-velocity dispersion power law relation at 10 Myr with a power law
index of 0.21. This correlation result in a distinct mass-size relationship for
bound clusters. We also provide valuable constraints on the gas dispersal
timescale during the star formation process and analyze the implications for
the formation of bound systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions from the Sun that propagate
through the heliosphere after launch. Observational studies of these transient
phenomena are usually based on 2D images of the Sun, corona, and heliosphere
(remote-sensing data), as well as magnetic field, plasma, and particle samples
along a 1D spacecraft trajectory (in-situ data). Given the large scales
involved and the 3D nature of CMEs, such measurements are generally
insufficient to build a comprehensive picture, especially in terms of local
variations and overall geometry of the whole structure. This White Paper aims
to address this issue by identifying the data sets and observational priorities
that are needed to effectively advance our current understanding of the
structure and evolution of CMEs, in both the remote-sensing and in-situ
regimes. It also provides an outlook of possible missions and instruments that
may yield significant improvements into the subject.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Formed at an early stage of gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, hydrides --
molecules containing a heavy element covalently bonded to one or more hydrogen
atoms -- play an important role in interstellar chemistry as they are the
progenitors of larger and more complex species in the interstellar medium. In
recent years, the careful analysis of the spectral signatures of hydrides have
led to their use as tracers of different constituents, and phases of the
interstellar medium and in particular the more diffuse environments. Diffuse
clouds form an essential link in the stellar gas life-cycle as they connect
both the late and early stages of stellar evolution. As a result, diffuse
clouds are continuously replenished by material which makes them reservoirs for
heavy elements and hence ideal laboratories for the study of astrochemistry.
This review will journey through a renaissance of hydride observations
detailing puzzling hydride discoveries and chemical mysteries with special
focus carbon-bearing hydrides to demonstrate the big impact of these small
molecules and ending with remarks on the future of their studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present detailed morphology measurements for 8.67 million galaxies in the
DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DECaLS, MzLS, and BASS, plus DES). These are
automated measurements made by deep learning models trained on Galaxy Zoo

The models are trained on newly-collected votes for DESI-LS DR8 images as well

Extending our morphology measurements outside of the previously-released
DECaLS/SDSS intersection increases our sky coverage by a factor of 4 (5,000 to

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With an annual production amounting to 800 kilotons, ferrite magnets
constitute the largest family of permanent magnets in volume, a demand that
will only increase as a consequence of the rare-earth crisis. With the global
goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener
manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic
processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented
here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite
magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step
sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these
processes, dense SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ceramic magnets with properties comparable
to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the
SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO$_2$ reaches a
coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in
energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to
conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of
the order of 7.109 kWh per year.</p>

          <p>Facing with grave climate change and enormous energy demand, catalyzer gets
more and more important due to its significant effect on reducing fossil fuels
consumption. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy.
Here we systematically explored atomic structures and related STM images of Se
defects in PtSe2. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable
conditions were detailly predicted. Besides, we found the vacancies are highly
kinetic stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2
can dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing with, even better than
Pt(111). Beyond, we firstly revealed that PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is
also a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies were
further confirmed by experimental measurements. We produced defective PtSe2 by
direct selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a CVD process. Then we observed
the HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much highly efficient than Pt
foils by a series of measurements. Our work with compelling theoretical and
experimental studies indicates PtSe2 with Se defects is an ideal bipolar
candidate for HER and OER.</p>

          <p>Metastable polymorphs often result from the interplay between thermodynamics
and kinetics. Despite advances in predictive synthesis for solution-based
techniques, there remains a lack of methods to design solid-state reactions
targeting metastable materials. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to
predict and control polymorph selectivity in solid-state reactions. This
framework presents reaction energy as a rarely used handle for polymorph
selection, which influences the role of surface energy in promoting the
nucleation of metastable phases. Through in situ characterization and density
functional theory calculations on two distinct synthesis pathways targeting
LiTiOPO4, we demonstrate how precursor selection and its effect on reaction
energy can effectively be used to control which polymorph is obtained from
solid-state synthesis. A general approach is outlined to quantify the
conditions under which metastable polymorphs are experimentally accessible.
With comparison to historical data, this approach suggests that using
appropriate precursors could enable the synthesis of many novel materials
through selective polymorph nucleation.</p>

          <p>According to density functional theory, any chemical property can be inferred

methods to obtain important chemical properties from model-predicted electron

physically relevant and useful electron density predictions. Despite not
training to predict atomic charges, the model is able to predict atomic charges
with an order of magnitude lower error than a sum of atomic charge densities.
Similarly, the model predicts dipole moments with half the error of the sum of
atomic charge densities method. We demonstrate that larger data sets lead to
more useful predictions in these tasks. These results pave the way for an
alternative path in atomistic machine learning, where data-driven approaches

          <p>We propose MatSci ML, a novel benchmark for modeling MATerials SCIence using
Machine Learning (MatSci ML) methods focused on solid-state materials with
periodic crystal structures. Applying machine learning methods to solid-state
materials is a nascent field with substantial fragmentation largely driven by
the great variety of datasets used to develop machine learning models. This
fragmentation makes comparing the performance and generalizability of different
methods difficult, thereby hindering overall research progress in the field.
Building on top of open-source datasets, including large-scale datasets like
the OpenCatalyst, OQMD, NOMAD, the Carolina Materials Database, and Materials
Project, the MatSci ML benchmark provides a diverse set of materials systems
and properties data for model training and evaluation, including simulated
energies, atomic forces, material bandgaps, as well as classification data for
crystal symmetries via space groups. The diversity of properties in MatSci ML
makes the implementation and evaluation of multi-task learning algorithms for
solid-state materials possible, while the diversity of datasets facilitates the
development of new, more generalized algorithms and methods across multiple
datasets. In the multi-dataset learning setting, MatSci ML enables researchers
to combine observations from multiple datasets to perform joint prediction of
common properties, such as energy and forces. Using MatSci ML, we evaluate the

demonstrated the capabilities of simple regression models to reproduce the

as well as provide abundance predictions for new candidate molecules. It
remains to be seen, however, to what degree TMC-1 is a ``unicorn'' in
astrochemistry, where the simplicity of its chemistry and physics readily
facilitates characterization with simple machine learning models. Here we
present an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star
forming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion
KL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ
chemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between
these components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected
appearance or even lack of likely species in various environments. This

          <p>Recent detections of aromatic species in dark molecular clouds suggest
formation pathways may be efficient at very low temperatures and pressures, yet
current astrochemical models are unable to account for their derived
abundances, which can often deviate from model predictions by several orders of
magnitude. The propargyl radical, a highly abundant species in the dark
molecular cloud TMC- 1, is an important aromatic precursor in combustion flames
and possibly interstellar environments. We performed astrochemical modeling of
TMC-1 using the three-phase gas-grain code NAUTILUS and an updated chemical
network, focused on refining the chemistry of the propargyl radical and related
species. The abundance of the propargyl radical has been increased by half an
order of magnitude compared to the previous GOTHAM network. This brings it
closer in line with observations, but it remains underestimated by two orders
of magnitude compared to its observed value. Predicted abundances for the
chemically related C4H3N isomers within an order of magnitude of observed
values corroborate the high efficiency of CN addition to closed-shell
hydrocarbons under dark molecular cloud conditions. The results of our modeling
provide insight into the chemical processes of the propargyl radical in dark
molecular clouds and highlight the importance of resonance-stabilized radicals
in PAH formation.</p>

understanding of their chemical inventories. Previous work by Lee et al. (2021)
demonstrated the capabilities of simple regression models to reproduce the
abundances of the chemical inventory of the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1),
as well as provide abundance predictions for new candidate molecules. It
remains to be seen, however, to what degree TMC-1 is a ``unicorn'' in
astrochemistry, where the simplicity of its chemistry and physics readily
facilitates characterization with simple machine learning models. Here we
present an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star
forming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion
KL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ
chemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between
these components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected
appearance or even lack of likely species in various environments. This
proof-of-concept study used similar regression models sampled by Lee et al.
(2021) to accurately reproduce the column densities from the XCLASS fitting
program presented in Crockett et al. (2014).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent detections of aromatic species in dark molecular clouds suggest
formation pathways may be efficient at very low temperatures and pressures, yet
current astrochemical models are unable to account for their derived
abundances, which can often deviate from model predictions by several orders of
magnitude. The propargyl radical, a highly abundant species in the dark
molecular cloud TMC- 1, is an important aromatic precursor in combustion flames
and possibly interstellar environments. We performed astrochemical modeling of
TMC-1 using the three-phase gas-grain code NAUTILUS and an updated chemical
network, focused on refining the chemistry of the propargyl radical and related
species. The abundance of the propargyl radical has been increased by half an
order of magnitude compared to the previous GOTHAM network. This brings it
closer in line with observations, but it remains underestimated by two orders
of magnitude compared to its observed value. Predicted abundances for the
chemically related C4H3N isomers within an order of magnitude of observed
values corroborate the high efficiency of CN addition to closed-shell
hydrocarbons under dark molecular cloud conditions. The results of our modeling
provide insight into the chemical processes of the propargyl radical in dark
molecular clouds and highlight the importance of resonance-stabilized radicals
in PAH formation.</p>
