          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most stars form in highly clustered environments within molecular clouds, but
eventually disperse into the distributed stellar field population. Exactly how
the stellar distribution evolves from the embedded stage into gas-free
associations and (bound) clusters is poorly understood. We investigate the
long-term evolution of stars formed in the STARFORGE simulation suite -- a set
of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming turbulent clouds
that include all key stellar feedback processes inherent to star formation. We
use Nbody6++GPU to follow the evolution of the young stellar systems after gas
removal. We use HDBSCAN to define stellar groups and analyze the stellar
kinematics to identify the true bound star clusters. The conditions modeled by
the simulations, i.e., global cloud surface densities below 0.15 g cm$^{-2}$,,
star formation efficiencies below 15%, and gas expulsion timescales shorter
than a free fall time, primarily produce expanding stellar associations and
small clusters. The largest star clusters, which have $\sim$1000 bound members,
form in the densest and lowest velocity dispersion clouds, representing
$\sim$32 and 39% of the stars in the simulations, respectively. The cloud's
early dynamical state plays a significant role in setting the classical star
formation efficiency versus bound fraction relation. All stellar groups follow
a narrow mass-velocity dispersion power law relation at 10 Myr with a power law
index of 0.21. This correlation result in a distinct mass-size relationship for
bound clusters. We also provide valuable constraints on the gas dispersal
timescale during the star formation process and analyze the implications for
the formation of bound systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions from the Sun that propagate
through the heliosphere after launch. Observational studies of these transient
phenomena are usually based on 2D images of the Sun, corona, and heliosphere
(remote-sensing data), as well as magnetic field, plasma, and particle samples
along a 1D spacecraft trajectory (in-situ data). Given the large scales
involved and the 3D nature of CMEs, such measurements are generally
insufficient to build a comprehensive picture, especially in terms of local
variations and overall geometry of the whole structure. This White Paper aims
to address this issue by identifying the data sets and observational priorities
that are needed to effectively advance our current understanding of the
structure and evolution of CMEs, in both the remote-sensing and in-situ
regimes. It also provides an outlook of possible missions and instruments that
may yield significant improvements into the subject.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Formed at an early stage of gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, hydrides --
molecules containing a heavy element covalently bonded to one or more hydrogen
atoms -- play an important role in interstellar chemistry as they are the
progenitors of larger and more complex species in the interstellar medium. In
recent years, the careful analysis of the spectral signatures of hydrides have
led to their use as tracers of different constituents, and phases of the
interstellar medium and in particular the more diffuse environments. Diffuse
clouds form an essential link in the stellar gas life-cycle as they connect
both the late and early stages of stellar evolution. As a result, diffuse
clouds are continuously replenished by material which makes them reservoirs for
heavy elements and hence ideal laboratories for the study of astrochemistry.
This review will journey through a renaissance of hydride observations
detailing puzzling hydride discoveries and chemical mysteries with special
focus carbon-bearing hydrides to demonstrate the big impact of these small
molecules and ending with remarks on the future of their studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present detailed morphology measurements for 8.67 million galaxies in the
DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DECaLS, MzLS, and BASS, plus DES). These are
automated measurements made by deep learning models trained on Galaxy Zoo

The models are trained on newly-collected votes for DESI-LS DR8 images as well

Extending our morphology measurements outside of the previously-released
DECaLS/SDSS intersection increases our sky coverage by a factor of 4 (5,000 to

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With an annual production amounting to 800 kilotons, ferrite magnets
constitute the largest family of permanent magnets in volume, a demand that
will only increase as a consequence of the rare-earth crisis. With the global
goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener
manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic
processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented
here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite
magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step
sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these
processes, dense SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ceramic magnets with properties comparable
to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the
SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO$_2$ reaches a
coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in
energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to
conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of
the order of 7.109 kWh per year.</p>

          <p>The article summarizes the study performed in the context of the Deloitte
Quantum Climate Challenge in 2023. We present a hybrid quantum-classical method
for calculating Potential Energy Surface scans, which are essential for
designing Metal-Organic Frameworks for Direct Air Capture applications. The
primary objective of this challenge was to highlight the potential advantages
of employing quantum computing. To evaluate the performance of the model, we
conducted total energy calculations using various computing frameworks and
methods. The results demonstrate, at a small scale, the potential advantage of
quantum computing-based models. We aimed to define relevant classical computing
model references for method benchmarking. The most important benefits of using
the PISQ approach for hybrid quantum-classical computational model development
and assessment are demonstrated.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Facing with grave climate change and enormous energy demand, catalyzer gets
more and more important due to its significant effect on reducing fossil fuels
consumption. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy.
Here we systematically explored atomic structures and related STM images of Se
defects in PtSe2. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable
conditions were detailly predicted. Besides, we found the vacancies are highly
kinetic stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2
can dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing with, even better than
Pt(111). Beyond, we firstly revealed that PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is
also a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies were
further confirmed by experimental measurements. We produced defective PtSe2 by
direct selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a CVD process. Then we observed
the HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much highly efficient than Pt
foils by a series of measurements. Our work with compelling theoretical and
experimental studies indicates PtSe2 with Se defects is an ideal bipolar
candidate for HER and OER.</p>
