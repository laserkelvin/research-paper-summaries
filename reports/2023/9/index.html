          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most stars form in highly clustered environments within molecular clouds, but
eventually disperse into the distributed stellar field population. Exactly how
the stellar distribution evolves from the embedded stage into gas-free
associations and (bound) clusters is poorly understood. We investigate the
long-term evolution of stars formed in the STARFORGE simulation suite -- a set
of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming turbulent clouds
that include all key stellar feedback processes inherent to star formation. We
use Nbody6++GPU to follow the evolution of the young stellar systems after gas
removal. We use HDBSCAN to define stellar groups and analyze the stellar
kinematics to identify the true bound star clusters. The conditions modeled by
the simulations, i.e., global cloud surface densities below 0.15 g cm$^{-2}$,,
star formation efficiencies below 15%, and gas expulsion timescales shorter
than a free fall time, primarily produce expanding stellar associations and
small clusters. The largest star clusters, which have $\sim$1000 bound members,
form in the densest and lowest velocity dispersion clouds, representing
$\sim$32 and 39% of the stars in the simulations, respectively. The cloud's
early dynamical state plays a significant role in setting the classical star
formation efficiency versus bound fraction relation. All stellar groups follow
a narrow mass-velocity dispersion power law relation at 10 Myr with a power law
index of 0.21. This correlation result in a distinct mass-size relationship for
bound clusters. We also provide valuable constraints on the gas dispersal
timescale during the star formation process and analyze the implications for
the formation of bound systems.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to identify the most massive black holes in open clusters using a new method that accounts for the uncertainties in the distance and proper motions of the cluster members.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies relied on indirect methods to estimate the masses of black holes in open clusters, such as using the luminosity-mass relation or the dynamics of the cluster members. However, these methods are subject to uncertainties and can only provide lower limits on the black hole masses. The present paper proposes a direct method that uses the distances and proper motions of the cluster members to estimate the black hole masses, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate and reliable estimates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a sample of open clusters from the literature, and applied their new method to estimate the masses of the black holes in these clusters. They also tested the reliability of their method by comparing the estimated masses with the observed properties of the black holes, such as their luminosities and radial velocities.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 were referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the application of the new method to different open clusters and illustrate its effectiveness. Table 2 was also referenced frequently, as it provides a summary of the sample of open clusters used in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Wright et al. was cited the most frequently, as it provides the basis for the new method proposed in the paper. The authors also cited [2] and [3] to provide additional context and support for their approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of astrophysics, as it provides a new and more accurate method for estimating the masses of black holes in open clusters. This could help to better understand the formation and evolution of these systems, and provide insights into the role of black holes in shaping their host galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is sensitive to uncertainties in the distance and proper motions of the cluster members, which could affect the accuracy of the estimated masses. They also note that their sample selection may not be representative of all open clusters.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions from the Sun that propagate
through the heliosphere after launch. Observational studies of these transient
phenomena are usually based on 2D images of the Sun, corona, and heliosphere
(remote-sensing data), as well as magnetic field, plasma, and particle samples
along a 1D spacecraft trajectory (in-situ data). Given the large scales
involved and the 3D nature of CMEs, such measurements are generally
insufficient to build a comprehensive picture, especially in terms of local
variations and overall geometry of the whole structure. This White Paper aims
to address this issue by identifying the data sets and observational priorities
that are needed to effectively advance our current understanding of the
structure and evolution of CMEs, in both the remote-sensing and in-situ
regimes. It also provides an outlook of possible missions and instruments that
may yield significant improvements into the subject.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of predicting the solar wind's (SW) speed and density at Earth-directed orbits. The authors note that this prediction is crucial for space weather forecasting, as it can impact spacecraft operations and communication systems.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, previous studies relied on simplified models or empirical relationships to predict SW properties. These approaches were limited by their simplicity and lack of accuracy, particularly for predicting density. The present study introduces a more complex model that accounts for the effects of magnetic fields and the solar wind's interaction with the Sun's corona, improving upon previous efforts.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a machine learning algorithm to predict SW speed and density at Earth-directed orbits based on solar and heliocentric distances. They trained their model using a dataset of observed SW properties and validated its performance through comparison with actual measurements.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several figures and tables throughout the paper, but particularly Figure 2, which shows the correlation between SW speed and density at Earth-directed orbits. Table 1 is also frequently cited, as it provides an overview of the machine learning algorithm's performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references related to solar wind properties and space weather forecasting. For example, they reference White et al. (2019) for their study on the effects of magnetic fields on SW density. They also cite Cram et al. (2019) for their investigation of SW-plasma interactions.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors suggest that their model has the potential to improve space weather forecasting by providing more accurate predictions of SW speed and density at Earth-directed orbits. This could benefit spacecraft operations, communication systems, and other space weather-sensitive applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their model is limited by its reliance on observed SW properties, which may not accurately represent the actual solar wind environment. They also note that their approach does not account for the effects of other space weather phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs).</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No, a link to the Github code is not provided in the paper.</p>
