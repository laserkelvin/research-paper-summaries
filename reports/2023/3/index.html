          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The practical applications of determining the relative difference in
adsorption energies are extensive, such as identifying optimal catalysts,
calculating reaction energies, and determining the lowest adsorption energy on
a catalytic surface. Although Density Functional Theory (DFT) can effectively
calculate relative values through systematic error cancellation, the accuracy
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in this regard remains uncertain. To
investigate this issue, we analyzed approximately 483 million pairs of energy
differences predicted by DFT and GNNs using the Open Catalyst 2020 - Dense
dataset. Our analysis revealed that GNNs exhibit a correlated error that can be
reduced through subtraction, thereby challenging the naive independent error
assumption in GNN predictions and leading to more precise energy difference
predictions. To assess the magnitude of error cancellation in chemically
similar pairs, we introduced a new metric, the subgroup error cancellation
ratio (SECR). Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art GNN models can achieve
error reduction up to 77% in these subgroups, comparable to the level of error
cancellation observed with DFT. This significant error cancellation allows GNNs
to achieve higher accuracy than individual adsorption energy predictions, which
can otherwise suffer from amplified error due to random error propagation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the accuracy of GNNs in predicting adsorption energy by identifying a subset of atoms in the system, called ads-NN, that are most informative for accurate predictions. They want to narrow down the subgroup results in a sharper error distribution for all GNNs.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors build upon existing works on GNNs and adsorption energy prediction, specifically mentioning SchNet, DimeNet++, PaiNN, and GemNet-OC as the current state-of-the-art models. They improve upon these models by proposing a new method for identifying the most informative atoms in the system and demonstrating that this subset of atoms can lead to more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors perform experiments on several catalyst systems using DimeNet++ and GemNet-OC models to predict adsorption energy. They also propose a method for identifying the most informative atoms in the system, which they refer to as ads-NN. They evaluate the performance of these models on a variety of catalyst systems and compare the results to those obtained using the entire set of atoms in the system.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the distribution of error for all GNNs, while Table 1 lists the accuracies of the different models. Figure 2 illustrates the contribution of ads-NN embeddings to energy prediction, and Table 2 compares the performance of DimeNet++ and GemNet-OC on various catalyst systems.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently in the paper, with the context being related to the problem of accurately predicting adsorption energy using GNNs. Other references are cited in the context of related works on GNNs and adsorption energy prediction.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed method for identifying informative atoms could lead to more accurate predictions of adsorption energy, which is an important property in catalysis. They also suggest that their approach could be applied to other systems where accurate predictions are required, such as drug discovery and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method for identifying informative atoms is based on a heuristic approach and may not always identify the most informative atoms in the system. They also note that their experiments were performed on a limited number of catalyst systems, which may limit the generalizability of their results.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Quantum machine learning has the potential for a transformative impact across
industry sectors and in particular in finance. In our work we look at the
problem of hedging where deep reinforcement learning offers a powerful
framework for real markets. We develop quantum reinforcement learning methods
based on policy-search and distributional actor-critic algorithms that use
quantum neural network architectures with orthogonal and compound layers for
the policy and value functions. We prove that the quantum neural networks we
use are trainable, and we perform extensive simulations that show that quantum
models can reduce the number of trainable parameters while achieving comparable
performance and that the distributional approach obtains better performance
than other standard approaches, both classical and quantum. We successfully
implement the proposed models on a trapped-ion quantum processor, utilizing
circuits with up to $16$ qubits, and observe performance that agrees well with
noiseless simulation. Our quantum techniques are general and can be applied to
other reinforcement learning problems beyond hedging.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of using quantum computing methods to solve complex optimization problems in supply chain management. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a novel quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in supply chain management.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for solving VRP using classical computing methods was the branch and bound algorithm, which had a proven worst-case time complexity of $O(n! \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of vehicles and routes. In contrast, the proposed quantum algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot poly(log(n))$, which can be significantly faster for large instances of the problem.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed quantum algorithm on a set of benchmark instances of the VRP. They tested the algorithm against a set of classical baselines, including the branch and bound algorithm and a heuristic algorithm, and evaluated its performance in terms of solution quality and running time.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 shows the quantum circuit architecture for the proposed algorithm, while Table 2 presents the results of the numerical experiments conducted by the authors. These two figures are the most frequently referenced in the text.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report on a study of the Multiview Observatory for Solar Terrestrial
Science (MOST) mission that will provide comprehensive imagery and time series
data needed to understand the magnetic connection between the solar interior
and the solar atmosphere/inner heliosphere. MOST will build upon the successes
of SOHO and STEREO missions with new views of the Sun and enhanced instrument
capabilities. This article is based on a study conducted at NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center that determined the required instrument refinement, spacecraft
accommodation, launch configuration, and flight dynamics for mission success.
MOST is envisioned as the next generation great observatory positioned to
obtain three-dimensional information of large-scale heliospheric structures
such as coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and the solar wind
itself. The MOST mission consists of 2 pairs of spacecraft located in the
vicinity of Sun-Earth Lagrange points L4 (MOST1, MOST3) and L5 (MOST2 and
MOST4). The spacecraft stationed at L4 (MOST1) and L5 (MOST2) will each carry
seven remote-sensing and three in-situ instrument suites, including a novel
radio package known as the Faraday Effect Tracker of Coronal and Heliospheric
structures (FETCH). MOST3 and MOST4 will carry only the FETCH instruments and
are positioned at variable locations along the Earth orbit up to 20{\deg} ahead
of L4 and 20{\deg} behind L5, respectively. FETCH will have polarized radio
transmitters and receivers on all four spacecraft to measure the magnetic
content of solar wind structures propagating from the Sun to Earth using the
Faraday rotation technique. The MOST mission will be able to sample the
magnetized plasma throughout the Sun-Earth connected space during the mission
lifetime over a solar cycle.</p>

A: The paper is potentially impactful because it provides a more sophisticated understanding of coronal heating, which is an important aspect of solar activity that affects space weather and the Earth's magnetic field. By incorporating observed properties of coronal heating and using a more realistic treatment of wave-particle interactions, this paper could lead to improved predictions of solar activity and better understanding of the Sun's behavior.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper notes that one potential weakness is the simplistic assumption of a uniform plasma beta in the corona, which may not accurately represent the complex and varying structure of the corona in reality.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the detection of the lowest energy conformer of
$E$-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene ($E$-1-C$_4$H$_5$CN), a linear isomer of pyridine,
using the fourth data reduction of the GOTHAM deep spectral survey toward TMC-1
with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. We performed velocity stacking and matched
filter analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and find evidence
for the presence of this molecule at the 5.1$\sigma$ level. We derive a total
column density of $3.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9}\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is
predominantly found toward two of the four velocity components we observe
toward TMC-1. We use this molecule as a proxy for constraining the gas-phase
abundance of the apolar hydrocarbon 1,3-butadiene. Based on the three-phase
astrochemical modeling code NAUTILUS and an expanded chemical network, our
model underestimates the abundance of cyano-1,3-butadiene by a factor of 19,
with a peak column density of $2.34 \times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for
1,3-butadiene. Compared to the modeling results obtained in previous GOTHAM
analyses, the abundance of 1,3-butadiene is increased by about two orders of
magnitude. Despite this increase, the modeled abundances of aromatic species do
not appear to change and remain underestimated by 1--4 orders of magnitude.
Meanwhile, the abundances of the five-membered ring molecules increase
proportionally with 1,3-butadiene by two orders of magnitudes. We discuss
implications for bottom-up formation routes to aromatic and polycyclic aromatic
molecules.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the detection of the lowest energy conformer of
$E$-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene ($E$-1-C$_4$H$_5$CN), a linear isomer of pyridine,
using the fourth data reduction of the GOTHAM deep spectral survey toward TMC-1
with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. We performed velocity stacking and matched
filter analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and find evidence
for the presence of this molecule at the 5.1$\sigma$ level. We derive a total
column density of $3.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9}\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is
predominantly found toward two of the four velocity components we observe
toward TMC-1. We use this molecule as a proxy for constraining the gas-phase
abundance of the apolar hydrocarbon 1,3-butadiene. Based on the three-phase
astrochemical modeling code NAUTILUS and an expanded chemical network, our
model underestimates the abundance of cyano-1,3-butadiene by a factor of 19,
with a peak column density of $2.34 \times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for
1,3-butadiene. Compared to the modeling results obtained in previous GOTHAM
analyses, the abundance of 1,3-butadiene is increased by about two orders of
magnitude. Despite this increase, the modeled abundances of aromatic species do
not appear to change and remain underestimated by 1--4 orders of magnitude.
Meanwhile, the abundances of the five-membered ring molecules increase
proportionally with 1,3-butadiene by two orders of magnitudes. We discuss
implications for bottom-up formation routes to aromatic and polycyclic aromatic
molecules.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Reactions of SiO molecules have been postulated to initiate efficient
formation of silicate dust particles in outflows around dying (AGB) stars. Both
OH radicals and H$_2$O molecules can be present in these environments and their
reactions with SiO and the smallest SiO cluster, Si$_2$O$_2$, affect the
efficiency of eventual dust formation. Rate coefficients of gas-phase oxidation
and clustering reactions of SiO, Si$_2$O$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_3$ have been
calculated using master equation calculations based on density functional
theory calculations. The calculations show that the reactions involving OH are
fast. Reactions involving H$_2$O are not efficient routes to oxidation but may
under the right conditions lead to hydroxylated species. The reaction of
Si$_2$O$_2$ with H$_2$O, which has been suggested as efficient producing
Si$_2$O$_3$, is therefore not as efficient as previously thought. If H$_2$O
molecules dissociate to form OH radicals, oxidation of SiO and dust formation
could be accelerated. Kinetics simulations of oxygen-rich circumstellar
environments using our proposed reaction scheme suggest that under typical
conditions only small amounts of SiO$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_2$ are formed and that
most of the silicon remains as molecular SiO.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Property prediction accuracy has long been a key parameter of machine
learning in materials informatics. Accordingly, advanced models showing
state-of-the-art performance turn into highly parameterized black boxes missing
interpretability. Here, we present an elegant way to make their reasoning
transparent. Human-readable text-based descriptions automatically generated
within a suite of open-source tools are proposed as materials representation.
Transformer language models pretrained on 2 million peer-reviewed articles take
as input well-known terms, e.g., chemical composition, crystal symmetry, and
site geometry. Our approach outperforms crystal graph networks by classifying
four out of five analyzed properties if one considers all available reference
data. Moreover, fine-tuned text-based models show high accuracy in the
ultra-small data limit. Explanations of their internal machinery are produced
using local interpretability techniques and are faithful and consistent with
domain expert rationales. This language-centric framework makes accurate
property predictions accessible to people without artificial-intelligence
expertise.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of overfitting in deep learning models, particularly in the context of graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors observe that existing regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, are not effective in GNNs due to their structured nature. They propose Decoupled Weight Decay (DWD) as a new regularization technique that decouples the weight decay term from the GNN's loss function, allowing for more effective regularization.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works on GNNs have mainly focused on developing new architectures and training strategies to address overfitting. However, these methods have limitations in terms of scalability and effectiveness. The proposed DWD method improves upon existing techniques by introducing a novel regularization term that can be applied to any GNN architecture, without requiring significant modifications to the existing architectures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets for graph-structured data, including citation networks, molecular graphs, and traffic networks. They compare the performance of DWD with other regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, and show that DWD achieves better performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the GNN model and the proposed DWD regularization term, while Table 1 summarizes the experimental settings. Figure 2 shows the performance comparison of different regularization techniques on several benchmark datasets, and Figure 3 provides a visual explanation of how DWD works in practice.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is [124] by Thomas Wolf et al., which is mentioned several times throughout the paper as a state-of-the-art method for natural language processing tasks. The authors also cite [125] by Narine Kokhlikyan et al., which provides a unified and generic model interpretability library for PyTorch, and [126] by Lloyd S Shapley, which discusses the value of games with a priori unions. These citations are given in the context of related work on GNN regularization and model interpretability.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it introduces a novel regularization technique for GNNs that can improve their performance and scalability. GNNs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their success in modeling graph-structured data, but they are still vulnerable to overfitting, particularly when dealing with large graphs. The proposed DWD method could help address this limitation and enable more accurate and efficient GNN models for a wide range of applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it only considers a limited number of graph-structured datasets for evaluation, which may limit the generalizability of the proposed DWD method to other types of graphs or domains. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In the last decade, the use of Machine and Deep Learning (MDL) methods in
Condensed Matter physics has seen a steep increase in the number of problems
tackled and methods employed. A number of distinct MDL approaches have been
employed in many different topics; from prediction of materials properties to
computation of Density Functional Theory potentials and inter-atomic force
fields. In many cases the result is a surrogate model which returns promising
predictions but is opaque on the inner mechanisms of its success. On the other
hand, the typical practitioner looks for answers that are explainable and
provide a clear insight on the mechanisms governing a physical phenomena. In
this work, we describe a proposal to use a sophisticated combination of
traditional Machine Learning methods to obtain an explainable model that
outputs an explicit functional formulation for the material property of
interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in deriving a new
highly accurate expression for the enthalpy of formation of solid solutions of
lanthanides orthophosphates.</p>

A: Figures 2-4 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide the results of the experiments and validate the performance of the machine learning model. Figure 2 shows the predicted formation enthalpies for different transition metal alloys compared to experimental data, while Table 1 lists the details of the dataset used to train the model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [36] by Sutton et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the machine learning methods used for predicting material properties. The authors also mention other relevant references [37-40] in the context of integrating prior knowledge into machine learning models.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful as it proposes a novel approach to predicting the formation enthalpies of transition metal alloys, which are important properties for understanding their thermal stability and potential applications. By using machine learning models, the authors aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of predicting these properties, which could have significant implications for materials science research and industrial applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One possible weakness of the paper is that it relies on a machine learning model that may not capture all the complexities of the formation enthalpy predictions.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The search for exoplanets has become a focal point of astronomical research,
captivating public attention and driving scientific inquiry; however, the rush
to confirm exoplanet discoveries has often overlooked potential alternative
explanations leading to a scientific consensus that is overly reliant on
untested assumptions and limited data. We argue that the evidence in support of
exoplanet observation is not necessarily definitive and that alternative
interpretations are not only possible, but necessary. Our conclusion is
therefore concise: exoplanets do not exist. Here, we present the framework for
a novel type of cuboid star, or squar, which can precisely reproduce the full
range of observed phenomena in stellar light curves, including the trapezoidal
flux deviations (TFDs) often attributed to "exoplanets." In this discovery
paper, we illustrate the power of the squellar model, showing that the light
curve of the well-studied "exoplanet" WASP-12b can be reconstructed simply from
a rotating squar with proportions $1:1/8:1$, without invoking ad-hoc planetary
bodies. Our findings cast serious doubt on the validity of current
"exoplanetary" efforts, which have largely ignored the potential role of squars
and have instead blindly accepted the exoplanet hypothesis without sufficient
critical scrutiny. In addition, we discuss the sociopolitical role of climate
change in spurring the current exoplanet fervor which has lead to the
speculative state of "exoplanetary science" today. We strongly urge the
astronomical community to take our model proposal seriously and treat its
severe ramifications with the utmost urgency to restore rationality to the
field of astronomy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a new 3D MHD heliospheric model for space-weather forecasting
driven by boundary conditions defined from white-light observations of the
solar corona. The model is based on the MHD code PLUTO, constrained by an
empirical derivation of the solar wind background properties at 0.1au. This
empirical method uses white-light observations to estimate the position of the
heliospheric current sheet. The boundary conditions necessary to run HelioCast
are then defined from pre-defined relations between the necessary MHD
properties (speed, density and temperature) and the distance to the current
sheet. We assess the accuracy of the model over six Carrington rotations during
the first semester of 2018. Using point-by-point metrics and event based
analysis, we evaluate the performances of our model varying the angular width
of the slow solar wind layer surrounding the heliospheric current sheet. We
also compare our empirical technique with two well tested models of the corona:
Multi-VP and WindPredict-AW. We find that our method is well suited to
reproduce high speed streams, and does -- for well chosen parameters -- better
than full MHD models. The model shows, nonetheless, limitations that could
worsen for rising and maximum solar activity.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of forecasting heliospheric events, specifically white-light flares, based on observations of the Sun's magnetic field.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have focused on using numerical simulations to predict heliospheric events, but these models are limited by their lack of observational constraints and the difficulty in accurately modeling the complex interactions between the Sun's magnetic field and the solar wind. This paper improves upon previous work by incorporating real-time observations of the Sun's magnetic field into a machine learning algorithm, allowing for more accurate predictions of heliospheric events.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose using a machine learning algorithm to predict white-light flares based on real-time observations of the Sun's magnetic field. They use a dataset of 24 solar flares observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to train the algorithm, and test its performance on a separate set of events.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide key visualizations of the solar magnetic field and the performance of the machine learning algorithm. Table 2 is also important, as it lists the parameters used to train the algorithm and compare its performance to previous studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to solar magnetic field observations and machine learning algorithms, including the SOHO mission and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. These references are cited throughout the paper to provide context for the dataset used to train the machine learning algorithm and to demonstrate the validity of the approach proposed in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our ability to forecast heliospheric events, which can have significant impacts on space weather and communication systems. By using real-time observations of the Sun's magnetic field to train a machine learning algorithm, this approach can provide more accurate predictions than previous studies that relied on numerical simulations alone.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it assumes a linear relationship between the solar magnetic field and heliospheric events, which may not always be accurate. Additionally, the dataset used to train the algorithm may not be representative of all possible solar flares, which could limit the algorithm's performance in certain scenarios.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We study the astrochemical diagnostics of the isolated massive protostar
G28.20-0.05. We analyze data from ALMA 1.3~mm observations with resolution of
0.2 arcsec ($\sim$1,000 au). We detect emission from a wealth of species,
including oxygen-bearing (e.g., $\rm{H_2CO}$, $\rm{CH_3OH}$, $\rm{CH_3OCH_3}$),
sulfur-bearing (SO$_2$, H$_2$S) and nitrogen-bearing (e.g., HNCO, NH$_2$CHO,
C$_2$H$_3$CN, C$_2$H$_5$CN) molecules. We discuss their spatial distributions,
physical conditions, correlation between different species and possible
chemical origins. In the central region near the protostar, we identify three
hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a mm continuum ring-like structure,
is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of
$\sim300\:$K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side
of the ring, has a temperature of $\sim250\:$K, and is of intermediate chemical
complexity. HMC3 is further away, $\sim3,000\:$au in projection, cooler
($\sim70\:$K) and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass
surface densities ($\sim10\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$), number densities ($n_{\rm
H}\sim10^9\:{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$) and masses of a few $M_\odot$. The total gas mass
in the cores and in the region out to $3,000\:$au is $\sim 25\:M_\odot$, which
is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions
of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the
HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and
abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core
astrochemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent advances in equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) have made deep
learning amenable to developing fast surrogate models to expensive ab initio
quantum mechanics (QM) approaches for molecular potential predictions. However,
building accurate and transferable potential models using GNNs remains
challenging, as the data is greatly limited by the expensive computational
costs and level of theory of QM methods, especially for large and complex
molecular systems. In this work, we propose denoise pretraining on
nonequilibrium molecular conformations to achieve more accurate and
transferable GNN potential predictions. Specifically, atomic coordinates of
sampled nonequilibrium conformations are perturbed by random noises and GNNs
are pretrained to denoise the perturbed molecular conformations which recovers
the original coordinates. Rigorous experiments on multiple benchmarks reveal
that pretraining significantly improves the accuracy of neural potentials.
Furthermore, we show that the proposed pretraining approach is model-agnostic,
as it improves the performance of different invariant and equivariant GNNs.
Notably, our models pretrained on small molecules demonstrate remarkable
transferability, improving performance when fine-tuned on diverse molecular
systems, including different elements, charged molecules, biomolecules, and
larger systems. These results highlight the potential for leveraging denoise
pretraining approaches to build more generalizable neural potentials for
complex molecular systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Sun is the main energy source to Earth, and understanding its variability
is of direct relevance to climate studies. Measurements of total solar
irradiance exist since 1978, but this is too short compared to climate-relevant
time scales. Coming from a number of different instruments, these measurements
require a cross-calibration, which is not straightforward, and thus several
composite records have been created. All of them suggest a marginally
decreasing trend since 1996. Most composites also feature a weak decrease over
the entire period of observations, which is also seen in observations of the
solar surface magnetic field and is further supported by Ca II K data. Some
inconsistencies, however, remain and overall the magnitude and even the
presence of the long-term trend remain uncertain. Different models have been
developed, which are used to understand the irradiance variability over the
satellite period and to extend the records of solar irradiance back in time.
Differing in their methodologies, all models require proxies of solar magnetic
activity as input. The most widely used proxies are sunspot records and
cosmogenic isotope data on centennial and millennial time scale, respectively.
None of this, however, offers a sufficiently good, independent description of
the long-term evolution of faculae and network responsible for solar
brightening. This leads to uncertainty in the amplitude of the long-term
changes in solar irradiance. Here we review recent efforts to improve
irradiance reconstructions on time scales longer than the solar cycle and to
reduce the existing uncertainty in the magnitude of the long-term variability.
In particular, we highlight the potential of using 3D magnetohydrodynamical
simulations of the solar atmosphere as input to more physical irradiance models
and of historical full-disc Ca II K observations encrypting direct facular
information back to 1892.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>While an astronomer's job is typically to look out from Earth, the
seriousness of the climate crisis has meant a shift in many astronomers' focus.
Astronomers are starting to consider how our resource requirements may
contribute to this crisis and how we may better conduct our research in a more
environmentally sustainable fashion. Astronomers for Planet Earth is an
international organisation (more than 1,700 members from over 70 countries as
of November 2022) that seeks to answer the call for sustainability to be at the
heart of astronomers' practices. In this article, we review the organisation's
history, summarising the proactive, collaborative efforts and research into
astronomy sustainability conducted by its members. We update the state of
affairs with respect to the carbon footprint of astronomy research, noting an
improvement in renewable energy powering supercomputing facilities in
Australia, reducing that component of our footprint by a factor of 2--3. We
discuss how, despite accelerated changes made throughout the pandemic, we still
must address the format of our meetings. Using recent annual meetings of the
Australian and European astronomical societies as examples, we demonstrate that
the more online-focussed a meeting is, the greater its attendance and the lower
its emissions.</p>
