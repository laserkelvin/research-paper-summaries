          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Reductive Lie Groups, such as the orthogonal groups, the Lorentz group, or
the unitary groups, play essential roles across scientific fields as diverse as
high energy physics, quantum mechanics, quantum chromodynamics, molecular
dynamics, computer vision, and imaging. In this paper, we present a general
Equivariant Neural Network architecture capable of respecting the symmetries of
the finite-dimensional representations of any reductive Lie Group G. Our
approach generalizes the successful ACE and MACE architectures for atomistic
point clouds to any data equivariant to a reductive Lie group action. We also
introduce the lie-nn software library, which provides all the necessary tools
to develop and implement such general G-equivariant neural networks. It
implements routines for the reduction of generic tensor products of
representations into irreducible representations, making it easy to apply our
architecture to a wide range of problems and groups. The generality and
performance of our approach are demonstrated by applying it to the tasks of top
quark decay tagging (Lorentz group) and shape recognition (orthogonal group).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Ergodicity, the central tenet of statistical mechanics, requires that an
isolated system will explore all of its available phase space permitted by
energetic and symmetry constraints. Mechanisms for violating ergodicity are of
great interest for probing non-equilibrium matter and for protecting quantum
coherence in complex systems. For decades, polyatomic molecules have served as
an intriguing and challenging platform for probing ergodicity breaking in
vibrational energy transport, particularly in the context of controlling
chemical reactions. Here, we report the observation of rotational ergodicity
breaking in an unprecedentedly large and symmetric molecule, 12C60. This is
facilitated by the first ever observation of icosahedral ro-vibrational fine
structure in any physical system, first predicted for 12C60 in 1986. The
ergodicity breaking exhibits several surprising features: first, there are
multiple transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes as the total
angular momentum is increased, and second, they occur well below the
traditional vibrational ergodicity threshold. These peculiar dynamics result
from the molecules' unique combination of symmetry, size, and rigidity,
highlighting the potential of fullerenes to uncover emergent phenomena in
mesoscopic quantum systems.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the mixing angle between the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances in the π-band of sodium using a point cloud registration-based technique. They want to improve upon the previous state of the art, which was limited by the accuracy of the J-dependent mean defect, and to provide a more accurate determination of the mixing angle.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for determining the mixing angle between the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances in sodium was limited by the accuracy of the J-dependent mean defect, which was estimated using a 7-point moving average. This paper improved upon this method by using a point cloud registration-based technique, which allows for more accurate determination of the mixing angle.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted absorption spectroscopy measurements on sodium to determine the mixing angle between the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances in the π-band. They used a point cloud registration-based technique to fit the mixing angle to the data, and derived the J-dependent mean defect from their fitting procedure.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures S1 and S2, as well as Table 1, are referenced most frequently in the text. Figure S1 shows the absorption spectrum of sodium in the π-band, while Figure S2 provides a detailed analysis of the mixing angle between the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances. Table 1 lists the J values of the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (13) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a detailed analysis of the avoided crossings in the T1u(3) R-branch. The citation is given in the context of discussing the peak widths at J = 215 and 267.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides a more accurate determination of the mixing angle between the T1u(3) and T1u(4) resonances in sodium, which is important for understanding the spectroscopic properties of this element. The proposed technique could also be applied to other systems where accurate determination of mixing angles is necessary.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a point cloud registration-based technique, which may not be suitable for all experimental conditions. Additionally, the accuracy of the J-dependent mean defect estimate may be limited by the number of data points used in the fitting procedure.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
