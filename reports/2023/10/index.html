          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Three-dimensional native states of natural proteins display recurring and
hierarchical patterns. Yet, traditional graph-based modeling of protein
structures is often limited to operate within a single fine-grained resolution,
and lacks hourglass neural architectures to learn those high-level building
blocks. We narrow this gap by introducing Ophiuchus, an SO(3)-equivariant
coarse-graining model that efficiently operates on all-atom protein structures.
Our model departs from current approaches that employ graph modeling, instead
focusing on local convolutional coarsening to model sequence-motif interactions
with efficient time complexity in protein length. We measure the reconstruction
capabilities of Ophiuchus across different compression rates, and compare it to
existing models. We examine the learned latent space and demonstrate its
utility through conformational interpolation. Finally, we leverage denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) in the latent space to efficiently sample
protein structures. Our experiments demonstrate Ophiuchus to be a scalable
basis for efficient protein modeling and generation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of protein structure prediction by developing a novel method called Ophiuchus, which combines sequence-to-sequence learning with a coarse-grained representation of the protein backbone. The authors seek to address the limitations of current methods, which rely on all-atom models or simplified templates, and instead propose a diffusion-based approach that can capture the complexity of protein structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work in protein structure prediction focused on template-free methods, such as Rosetta and LigandFold, which rely solely on sequence information to predict structures. Ophiuchus improves upon these methods by integrating a coarse-grained representation of the backbone, allowing for faster and more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of Ophiuchus. They compared the predicted structures from Ophiuchus with those obtained using all-atom models (Rosetta and AMBER) and simplified templates (De novo Diffusion and RFDiffusion). They also analyzed the designability of sampled backbones, showed a comparison of scTM scores for Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and visualized reconstruction of all-atom proteins and backbones.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 12, 13, and 14 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide information on the designability of sampled backbones, the comparison of scTM scores between Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and the self-consistency template matching scores for Ophiuchus diffusion.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of protein structure prediction and the limitations of current methods. The authors also cite [2] for its contribution to the development of coarse-grained models for protein structure prediction.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental
changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic
particle interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic
structures. Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for
understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries
of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to
maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and
discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We
employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various
symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in
different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal
structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the
time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in
diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local
interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks
due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional
neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate
these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed
structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns,
we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that
parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant
functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward
implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN
architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks,
such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local
interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force
fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of immense interest in applications such
as gas storage and carbon capture due to their exceptional porosity and tunable
chemistry. Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods
to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in
accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods
to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of
the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a
coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a
denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building
blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly
algorithm. Equivariant graph neural networks are used for the diffusion model
to respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We
comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF
structures and its effectiveness in designing outstanding MOF materials for
carbon capture applications with molecular simulations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through the use of machine learning (ML) and generative models.

However, these approaches were limited by their reliance on simplified models and lack of consideration for real-world synthesis conditions. The proposed methodology in this paper improves upon these existing techniques by incorporating real-world constraints and using more accurate models to predict MOF properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Foundation models have been transformational in machine learning fields such
as natural language processing and computer vision. Similar success in atomic
property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training
effective models across multiple chemical domains. To address this, we
introduce Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP), a supervised pre-training
strategy that simultaneously trains on multiple datasets from different
chemical domains, treating each dataset as a unique pre-training task within a
multi-task framework. Our combined training dataset consists of $\sim$120M
systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and
generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and
datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22. JMP
demonstrates an average improvement of 59% over training from scratch, and
matches or sets state-of-the-art on 34 out of 40 tasks. Our work highlights the
potential of pre-training strategies that utilize diverse data to advance
property prediction across chemical domains, especially for low-data tasks.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Structure determination is necessary to identify unknown organic molecules,
such as those in natural products, forensic samples, the interstellar medium,
and laboratory syntheses. Rotational spectroscopy enables structure
determination by providing accurate 3D information about small organic
molecules via their moments of inertia. Using these moments, Kraitchman
analysis determines isotopic substitution coordinates, which are the unsigned
$|x|,|y|,|z|$ coordinates of all atoms with natural isotopic abundance,
including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. While unsigned substitution coordinates
can verify guesses of structures, the missing $+/-$ signs make it challenging
to determine the actual structure from the substitution coordinates alone. To
tackle this inverse problem, we develop KREED (Kraitchman
REflection-Equivariant Diffusion), a generative diffusion model that infers a
molecule's complete 3D structure from its molecular formula, moments of
inertia, and unsigned substitution coordinates of heavy atoms. KREED's top-1
predictions identify the correct 3D structure with >98% accuracy on the QM9 and
GEOM datasets when provided with substitution coordinates of all heavy atoms
with natural isotopic abundance. When substitution coordinates are restricted
to only a subset of carbons, accuracy is retained at 91% on QM9 and 32% on
GEOM. On a test set of experimentally measured substitution coordinates
gathered from the literature, KREED predicts the correct all-atom 3D structure
in 25 of 33 cases, demonstrating experimental applicability for context-free 3D
structure determination with rotational spectroscopy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>(Abridged) Electron-molecule interaction is a fundamental process in
radiation-driven chemistry in space, from the interstellar medium to comets.
Therefore, knowledge of interaction cross-sections is key. While there has been
a plethora of studies of total ionization cross-sections, data is often spread
over many sources, or not public or readily available. We introduce the
Astrochemistry Low-energy Electron Cross-Section (ALeCS) database, a public
database for electron interaction cross-sections and ionization rates for
molecules of astrochemical interest. In this work, we present the first data
release comprising total ionization cross-sections and ionization rates for
over 200 neutral molecules. We include optimized geometries and molecular
orbital energies at various levels of theory, and for a subset of the
molecules, the ionization potentials. We compute total ionization
cross-sections using the binary-encounter Bethe model and screening-corrected
additivity rule, and ionization rates and reaction network coefficients for
molecular cloud environments for $>$200 neutral molecules ranging from
diatomics to complex organics. We demonstrate that our binary-encounter Bethe
cross-sections agree well with experimental data. We show that the ionization
rates scale roughly linearly with the number of constituent atoms in the
molecule. We introduce and describe the public ALeCS database. For the initial
release, we include total ionization cross-sections for $>$200 neutral
molecules and several cations and anions calculated with different levels of
quantum chemistry theory, the chemical reaction rates for the ionization, and
network files in the formats of the two most popular astrochemical networks,
the KIDA and UMIST. The database will be continuously updated for more
molecules and interactions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present AstroCLIP, a single, versatile model that can embed both galaxy
images and spectra into a shared, physically meaningful latent space. These
embeddings can then be used - without any model fine-tuning - for a variety of
downstream tasks including (1) accurate in-modality and cross-modality semantic
similarity search, (2) photometric redshift estimation, (3) galaxy property
estimation from both images and spectra, and (4) morphology classification. Our
approach to implementing AstroCLIP consists of two parts. First, we embed
galaxy images and spectra separately by pretraining separate transformer-based
image and spectrum encoders in self-supervised settings. We then align the
encoders using a contrastive loss. We apply our method to spectra from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and images from its corresponding Legacy
Imaging Survey. Overall, we find remarkable performance on all downstream
tasks, even relative to supervised baselines. For example, for a task like
photometric redshift prediction, we find similar performance to a
specifically-trained ResNet18, and for additional tasks like physical property
estimation (stellar mass, age, metallicity, and sSFR), we beat this supervised
baseline by 19\% in terms of $R^2$. We also compare our results to a
state-of-the-art self-supervised single-modal model for galaxy images, and find
that our approach outperforms this benchmark by roughly a factor of two on
photometric redshift estimation and physical property prediction in terms of
$R^2$, while remaining roughly in-line in terms of morphology classification.
Ultimately, our approach represents the first cross-modal self-supervised model
for galaxies, and the first self-supervised transformer-based architectures for
galaxy images and spectra.</p>
