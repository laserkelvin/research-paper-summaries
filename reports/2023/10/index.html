          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Three-dimensional native states of natural proteins display recurring and
hierarchical patterns. Yet, traditional graph-based modeling of protein
structures is often limited to operate within a single fine-grained resolution,
and lacks hourglass neural architectures to learn those high-level building
blocks. We narrow this gap by introducing Ophiuchus, an SO(3)-equivariant
coarse-graining model that efficiently operates on all-atom protein structures.
Our model departs from current approaches that employ graph modeling, instead
focusing on local convolutional coarsening to model sequence-motif interactions
with efficient time complexity in protein length. We measure the reconstruction
capabilities of Ophiuchus across different compression rates, and compare it to
existing models. We examine the learned latent space and demonstrate its
utility through conformational interpolation. Finally, we leverage denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) in the latent space to efficiently sample
protein structures. Our experiments demonstrate Ophiuchus to be a scalable
basis for efficient protein modeling and generation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of protein structure prediction by developing a novel method called Ophiuchus, which combines sequence-to-sequence learning with a coarse-grained representation of the protein backbone. The authors seek to address the limitations of current methods, which rely on all-atom models or simplified templates, and instead propose a diffusion-based approach that can capture the complexity of protein structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work in protein structure prediction focused on template-free methods, such as Rosetta and LigandFold, which rely solely on sequence information to predict structures. Ophiuchus improves upon these methods by integrating a coarse-grained representation of the backbone, allowing for faster and more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of Ophiuchus. They compared the predicted structures from Ophiuchus with those obtained using all-atom models (Rosetta and AMBER) and simplified templates (De novo Diffusion and RFDiffusion). They also analyzed the designability of sampled backbones, showed a comparison of scTM scores for Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and visualized reconstruction of all-atom proteins and backbones.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 12, 13, and 14 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide information on the designability of sampled backbones, the comparison of scTM scores between Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and the self-consistency template matching scores for Ophiuchus diffusion.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of protein structure prediction and the limitations of current methods. The authors also cite [2] for its contribution to the development of coarse-grained models for protein structure prediction.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for the field of protein structure prediction, as it proposes a novel method that combines sequence-to-sequence learning with a coarse-grained representation of the backbone. This approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of protein structure prediction, which is crucial for understanding protein function and developing new drugs.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental
changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic
particle interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic
structures. Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for
understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries
of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to
maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and
discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We
employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various
symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in
different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal
structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the
time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in
diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local
interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks
due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional
neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate
these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed
structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns,
we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that
parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant
functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward
implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN
architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks,
such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local
interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force
fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of immense interest in applications such
as gas storage and carbon capture due to their exceptional porosity and tunable
chemistry. Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods
to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in
accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods
to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of
the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a
coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a
denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building
blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly
algorithm. Equivariant graph neural networks are used for the diffusion model
to respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We
comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF
structures and its effectiveness in designing outstanding MOF materials for
carbon capture applications with molecular simulations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through the use of machine learning (ML) and generative models.

However, these approaches were limited by their reliance on simplified models and lack of consideration for real-world synthesis conditions. The proposed methodology in this paper improves upon these existing techniques by incorporating real-world constraints and using more accurate models to predict MOF properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Foundation models have been transformational in machine learning fields such
as natural language processing and computer vision. Similar success in atomic
property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training
effective models across multiple chemical domains. To address this, we
introduce Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP), a supervised pre-training
strategy that simultaneously trains on multiple datasets from different
chemical domains, treating each dataset as a unique pre-training task within a
multi-task framework. Our combined training dataset consists of $\sim$120M
systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and
generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and
datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22. JMP
demonstrates an average improvement of 59% over training from scratch, and
matches or sets state-of-the-art on 34 out of 40 tasks. Our work highlights the
potential of pre-training strategies that utilize diverse data to advance
property prediction across chemical domains, especially for low-data tasks.
