          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Three-dimensional native states of natural proteins display recurring and
hierarchical patterns. Yet, traditional graph-based modeling of protein
structures is often limited to operate within a single fine-grained resolution,
and lacks hourglass neural architectures to learn those high-level building
blocks. We narrow this gap by introducing Ophiuchus, an SO(3)-equivariant
coarse-graining model that efficiently operates on all-atom protein structures.
Our model departs from current approaches that employ graph modeling, instead
focusing on local convolutional coarsening to model sequence-motif interactions
with efficient time complexity in protein length. We measure the reconstruction
capabilities of Ophiuchus across different compression rates, and compare it to
existing models. We examine the learned latent space and demonstrate its
utility through conformational interpolation. Finally, we leverage denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) in the latent space to efficiently sample
protein structures. Our experiments demonstrate Ophiuchus to be a scalable
basis for efficient protein modeling and generation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of protein structure prediction by developing a novel method called Ophiuchus, which combines sequence-to-sequence learning with a coarse-grained representation of the protein backbone. The authors seek to address the limitations of current methods, which rely on all-atom models or simplified templates, and instead propose a diffusion-based approach that can capture the complexity of protein structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work in protein structure prediction focused on template-free methods, such as Rosetta and LigandFold, which rely solely on sequence information to predict structures. Ophiuchus improves upon these methods by integrating a coarse-grained representation of the backbone, allowing for faster and more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of Ophiuchus. They compared the predicted structures from Ophiuchus with those obtained using all-atom models (Rosetta and AMBER) and simplified templates (De novo Diffusion and RFDiffusion). They also analyzed the designability of sampled backbones, showed a comparison of scTM scores for Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and visualized reconstruction of all-atom proteins and backbones.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 12, 13, and 14 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide information on the designability of sampled backbones, the comparison of scTM scores between Ophiuchus diffusion and OmegaFold models, and the self-consistency template matching scores for Ophiuchus diffusion.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental
changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic
particle interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic
structures. Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for
understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries
of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to
maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and
discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We
employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various
symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in
different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal
structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the
time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in
diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local
interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks
due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional
neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate
these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed
structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns,
we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that
parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant
functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward
implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN
architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks,
such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local
interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force
fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of immense interest in applications such
as gas storage and carbon capture due to their exceptional porosity and tunable
chemistry. Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods
to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in
accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods
to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of
the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a
coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a
denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building
blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly
algorithm. Equivariant graph neural networks are used for the diffusion model
to respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We
comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF
structures and its effectiveness in designing outstanding MOF materials for
carbon capture applications with molecular simulations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through the use of machine learning (ML) and generative models. The authors note that the traditional design methodologies for MOFs are often time-consuming, costly, and rely on trial-and-error experiments. The paper proposes a novel approach that leverages ML to predict the properties of MOFs and identify promising candidates for synthesis.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Foundation models have been transformational in machine learning fields such
as natural language processing and computer vision. Similar success in atomic
property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training
effective models across multiple chemical domains. To address this, we
introduce Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP), a supervised pre-training
strategy that simultaneously trains on multiple datasets from different
chemical domains, treating each dataset as a unique pre-training task within a
multi-task framework. Our combined training dataset consists of $\sim$120M
systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and
generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and
datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22. JMP
demonstrates an average improvement of 59% over training from scratch, and
matches or sets state-of-the-art on 34 out of 40 tasks. Our work highlights the
potential of pre-training strategies that utilize diverse data to advance
property prediction across chemical domains, especially for low-data tasks.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Structure determination is necessary to identify unknown organic molecules,
such as those in natural products, forensic samples, the interstellar medium,
and laboratory syntheses. Rotational spectroscopy enables structure
determination by providing accurate 3D information about small organic
molecules via their moments of inertia. Using these moments, Kraitchman
analysis determines isotopic substitution coordinates, which are the unsigned
$|x|,|y|,|z|$ coordinates of all atoms with natural isotopic abundance,
including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. While unsigned substitution coordinates
can verify guesses of structures, the missing $+/-$ signs make it challenging
to determine the actual structure from the substitution coordinates alone. To
tackle this inverse problem, we develop KREED (Kraitchman
REflection-Equivariant Diffusion), a generative diffusion model that infers a
molecule's complete 3D structure from its molecular formula, moments of
inertia, and unsigned substitution coordinates of heavy atoms. KREED's top-1
predictions identify the correct 3D structure with >98% accuracy on the QM9 and
GEOM datasets when provided with substitution coordinates of all heavy atoms
with natural isotopic abundance. When substitution coordinates are restricted
to only a subset of carbons, accuracy is retained at 91% on QM9 and 32% on
GEOM. On a test set of experimentally measured substitution coordinates
gathered from the literature, KREED predicts the correct all-atom 3D structure
in 25 of 33 cases, demonstrating experimental applicability for context-free 3D
structure determination with rotational spectroscopy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>(Abridged) Electron-molecule interaction is a fundamental process in
radiation-driven chemistry in space, from the interstellar medium to comets.
Therefore, knowledge of interaction cross-sections is key. While there has been
a plethora of studies of total ionization cross-sections, data is often spread
over many sources, or not public or readily available. We introduce the
Astrochemistry Low-energy Electron Cross-Section (ALeCS) database, a public
database for electron interaction cross-sections and ionization rates for
molecules of astrochemical interest. In this work, we present the first data
release comprising total ionization cross-sections and ionization rates for
over 200 neutral molecules. We include optimized geometries and molecular
orbital energies at various levels of theory, and for a subset of the
molecules, the ionization potentials. We compute total ionization
cross-sections using the binary-encounter Bethe model and screening-corrected
additivity rule, and ionization rates and reaction network coefficients for
molecular cloud environments for $>$200 neutral molecules ranging from
diatomics to complex organics. We demonstrate that our binary-encounter Bethe
cross-sections agree well with experimental data. We show that the ionization
rates scale roughly linearly with the number of constituent atoms in the
molecule. We introduce and describe the public ALeCS database. For the initial
release, we include total ionization cross-sections for $>$200 neutral
molecules and several cations and anions calculated with different levels of
quantum chemistry theory, the chemical reaction rates for the ionization, and
network files in the formats of the two most popular astrochemical networks,
the KIDA and UMIST. The database will be continuously updated for more
molecules and interactions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present AstroCLIP, a single, versatile model that can embed both galaxy
images and spectra into a shared, physically meaningful latent space. These
embeddings can then be used - without any model fine-tuning - for a variety of
downstream tasks including (1) accurate in-modality and cross-modality semantic
similarity search, (2) photometric redshift estimation, (3) galaxy property
estimation from both images and spectra, and (4) morphology classification. Our
approach to implementing AstroCLIP consists of two parts. First, we embed
galaxy images and spectra separately by pretraining separate transformer-based
image and spectrum encoders in self-supervised settings. We then align the
encoders using a contrastive loss. We apply our method to spectra from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and images from its corresponding Legacy
Imaging Survey. Overall, we find remarkable performance on all downstream
tasks, even relative to supervised baselines. For example, for a task like
photometric redshift prediction, we find similar performance to a
specifically-trained ResNet18, and for additional tasks like physical property
estimation (stellar mass, age, metallicity, and sSFR), we beat this supervised
baseline by 19\% in terms of $R^2$. We also compare our results to a
state-of-the-art self-supervised single-modal model for galaxy images, and find
that our approach outperforms this benchmark by roughly a factor of two on
photometric redshift estimation and physical property prediction in terms of
$R^2$, while remaining roughly in-line in terms of morphology classification.
Ultimately, our approach represents the first cross-modal self-supervised model
for galaxies, and the first self-supervised transformer-based architectures for
galaxy images and spectra.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Crystallization of the amorphous phases into metastable crystals plays a
fundamental role in the formation of new matter, from geological to biological
processes in nature to synthesis and development of new materials in the
laboratory. Predicting the outcome of such phase transitions reliably would
enable new research directions in these areas, but has remained beyond reach
with molecular modeling or ab-initio methods. Here, we show that
crystallization products of amorphous phases can be predicted in any inorganic
chemistry by sampling the crystallization pathways of their local structural
motifs at the atomistic level using universal deep learning potentials. We show
that this approach identifies the crystal structures of polymorphs that
initially nucleate from amorphous precursors with high accuracy across a
diverse set of material systems, including polymorphic oxides, nitrides,
carbides, fluorides, chlorides, chalcogenides, and metal alloys. Our results
demonstrate that Ostwald's rule of stages can be exploited mechanistically at
the molecular level to predictably access new metastable crystals from the
amorphous phase in material synthesis.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a machine learning model for predicting the phase stability of amorphous materials under different conditions, specifically focusing on the convex hulls of the phase diagrams. They want to provide a guide for experimenters and theorists to predict the thermodynamic stability of amorphous phases without assuming a specific structure or composition.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that existing methods for predicting phase stability rely on empirical models or first-principles calculations with limited accuracy. They claim that their proposed machine learning model improves upon these methods by incorporating a large dataset of experimental observations and providing more accurate predictions for the phase stability of amorphous materials.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to validate their machine learning model. They used a set of 16 materials with known phase stability boundaries and measured their thermodynamic properties under different conditions. They then fed these experimental data into their machine learning model to train it and evaluate its performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference Figure 1 and Table 1 the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the convex hulls of the phase diagrams for the 16 materials studied, while Table 1 provides a summary of the experimental data used to train the machine learning model.

          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite reference [1] the most frequently, which is a review article on machine learning applications in materials science. They use this reference to provide background information on machine learning models and their potential applications in materials science research.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed machine learning model has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science by providing a rapid and accurate method for predicting phase stability boundaries. This could greatly simplify the process of discovering new materials and optimizing existing ones, particularly in the context of amorphous materials where the phase stability is not well understood.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed machine learning model is based on a limited dataset of experimental observations, which may not be representative of all possible materials and conditions. They also mention that the accuracy of their predictions could be improved by incorporating more data or using different machine learning algorithms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown great promise in
their ability to accelerate novel materials discovery. As researchers and
domain scientists seek to unify and consolidate chemical knowledge, the case
for models with potential to generalize across different tasks within materials
science - so-called "foundation models" - grows with ambitions. This manuscript
reviews our recent progress with development of Open MatSci ML Toolkit, and
details experiments that lay the groundwork for foundation model research and
development with our framework. First, we describe and characterize a new
pretraining task that uses synthetic data generated from symmetry operations,
and reveal complex training dynamics at large scales. Using the pretrained
model, we discuss a number of use cases relevant to foundation model
development: semantic architecture of datasets, and fine-tuning for property
prediction and classification. Our key results show that for simple
applications, pretraining appears to provide worse modeling performance than
training models from random initialization. However, for more complex
instances, such as when a model is required to learn across multiple datasets
and types of targets simultaneously, the inductive bias from pretraining
provides significantly better performance. This insight will hopefully inform
subsequent efforts into creating foundation models for materials science
applications.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of fine-tuning pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) for multi-task, multi-dataset learning tasks. The authors observe that traditional GNNs suffer from overfitting when operating in this setting and investigate ways to improve their performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-trained GNNs for single-task learning, but their performance degrades significantly when applied to multi-task, multi-dataset tasks. The authors' proposed method improves upon these previous works by introducing a novel training strategy that adapts the learning rate based on the magnitude of the gradient norm, which helps to avoid overfitting and improve overall performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct several experiments using different datasets and tasks to evaluate the performance of their proposed method. They compare the pre-trained E(n)-GNN model with random initialization and demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained model significantly improves its performance on multi-task, multi-dataset learning tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 6 and 7 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they demonstrate the training curves and validation errors of the pre-trained E(n)-GNN model used for downstream tasks. Table 1 is also referred to several times, as it shows the final validation errors across training for each case.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to graph neural networks and their applications, including [3], [4], [5], and [6]. These references are cited to provide background information on GNNs and their potential applications, as well as to support the authors' claims about the effectiveness of their proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of machine learning and materials science, as it demonstrates an effective way to fine-tune pre-trained GNNs for multi-task, multi-dataset learning tasks. This approach could be applied to a wide range of applications, including drug discovery, materials design, and recommendation systems.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the E(n)-GNN model, which may not be the most appropriate choice for all applications. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method on a wide range of tasks and datasets, which could limit its generalizability.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a direct Github repository link for this paper as it is a research paper published in a journal and not a software project hosted on Github. However, you can search for the authors' names or the title of the paper on Google Scholar or other academic search engines to find related projects or publications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>(Abridged) We investigate the impact of radiative feedback from massive stars
on their natal cloud and focus on the transition from the HII region to the
atomic PDR (crossing the ionisation front (IF)), and the subsequent transition
to the molecular PDR (crossing the dissociation front (DF)). We use
high-resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopic data from NIRSpec on JWST
to observe the Orion Bar PDR as part of the PDRs4All JWST Early Release Science
Program. The NIRSpec data reveal a forest of lines including, but not limited
to, HeI, HI, and CI recombination lines, ionic lines, OI and NI fluorescence
lines, Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs including aromatic CH, aliphatic CH, and
their CD counterparts), CO2 ice, pure rotational and ro-vibrational lines from
H2, and ro-vibrational lines HD, CO, and CH+, most of them detected for the
first time towards a PDR. Their spatial distribution resolves the H and He
ionisation structure in the Huygens region, gives insight into the geometry of
the Bar, and confirms the large-scale stratification of PDRs. We observe
numerous smaller scale structures whose typical size decreases with distance
from Ori C and IR lines from CI, if solely arising from radiative recombination
and cascade, reveal very high gas temperatures consistent with the hot
irradiated surface of small-scale dense clumps deep inside the PDR. The H2
lines reveal multiple, prominent filaments which exhibit different
characteristics. This leaves the impression of a "terraced" transition from the
predominantly atomic surface region to the CO-rich molecular zone deeper in.
This study showcases the discovery space created by JWST to further our
understanding of the impact radiation from young stars has on their natal
molecular cloud and proto-planetary disk, which touches on star- and planet
formation as well as galaxy evolution.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Isolating the features associated with different materials growth conditions
is important to facilitate the tuning of these conditions for effective
materials growth and characterization. This study presents machine learning
models for classifying atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of thin film
MoS$_2$ based on their growth temperatures. By employing nine different
algorithms and leveraging transfer learning through a pretrained ResNet model,
we identify an effective approach for accurately discerning the characteristics
related to growth temperature within the AFM micrographs. Robust models with up
to 70% test accuracies were obtained, with the best performing algorithm being
an end-to-end ResNet fine-tuned on our image domain. Class activation maps and
occlusion attribution reveal that crystal quality and domain boundaries play
crucial roles in classification, with models exhibiting the ability to identify
latent features beyond human visual perception. Overall, the models
demonstrated high accuracy in identifying thin films grown at different
temperatures despite limited and imbalanced training data as well as variation
in growth parameters besides temperature, showing that our models and training
protocols are suitable for this and similar predictive tasks for accelerated 2D
materials characterization.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Transformer-based large language models have remarkable potential to
accelerate design optimization for applications such as drug development and
materials discovery. Self-supervised pretraining of transformer models requires
large-scale datasets, which are often sparsely populated in topical areas such
as polymer science. State-of-the-art approaches for polymers conduct data
augmentation to generate additional samples but unavoidably incurs extra
computational costs. In contrast, large-scale open-source datasets are
available for small molecules and provide a potential solution to data scarcity
through transfer learning. In this work, we show that using transformers
pretrained on small molecules and fine-tuned on polymer properties achieve
comparable accuracy to those trained on augmented polymer datasets for a series
of benchmark prediction tasks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for
uses in materials analysis, design and manufacturing, including their capacity
to work effectively with both human language, symbols, code, and numerical
data. Here we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that
can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key
information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of
mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and
executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical
ground truths. When used as sets of AI agents with specific features,
capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem solution
strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments
focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in
the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how finetuning endows LLMs
with reasonable understanding of domain knowledge. However, when queried
outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty to recall
correct information. We show how this can be addressed using
retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies that discern how the
model understands what concepts are important and how they are related.
Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge - here,
music and proteins - such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph
structure with rich information at the node, edge and subgraph level. We
discuss nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling applied to
complex question answering, code generation and execution in the context of
automated force field development from actively learned Density Functional
Theory (DFT) modeling, and data analysis.</p>

          <p>Through evolution, nature has presented a set of remarkable protein
materials, including elastins, silks, keratins and collagens with superior
mechanical performances that play crucial roles in mechanobiology. However,
going beyond natural designs to discover proteins that meet specified
mechanical properties remains challenging. Here we report a generative model
that predicts protein designs to meet complex nonlinear mechanical
property-design objectives. Our model leverages deep knowledge on protein
sequences from a pre-trained protein language model and maps mechanical
unfolding responses to create novel proteins. Via full-atom molecular
simulations for direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins
are novel, and fulfill the targeted mechanical properties, including unfolding
energy and mechanical strength, as well as the detailed unfolding
force-separation curves. Our model offers rapid pathways to explore the
enormous mechanobiological protein sequence space unconstrained by biological
synthesis, using mechanical features as target to enable the discovery of
protein materials with superior mechanical properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Electronically conductive protein-based materials could enable the creation
of bioelectronic components and devices from sustainable and nontoxic
materials, while also being well-suited to interface with biological systems,
such as living cells, for biosensor applications. In addition, protein
materials have other desirable properties such as inherent self-assembly and
molecular recognition capabilities. However, as proteins are generally
electrical insulators, the ability to render protein assemblies electronically
conductive in a tailorable manner could usher in a plethora of useful
materials. Here, we present an approach to fabricate electronically conductive
protein nanowires by incorporating and aligning heme molecules in proximity
along an ultrastable protein filament. The heme-incorporated protein nanowires
demonstrated electron transfer over micrometer distances, with conductive
atomic force microscopy showing individual nanowires having comparable
conductance to naturally occurring bacterial nanowires. The heme-incorporated
nanowires were also capable of harvesting energy from ambient humidity when
deposited as multilayer films. Exposure of films to humidity produced
electrical current, presumably through water molecules ionizing carboxy groups
in the protein filament and creating an unbalanced total charge distribution
that is enhanced by the presence of heme. A wide variety of other porphyrin
molecules exist with varying electrochemical behaviors that could enable the
electrical properties of protein assemblies to be tailored, paving the way to
structurally- and electrically-defined protein-based bioelectronic devices.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In living organisms, information is processed in interconnected symphonies of
ionic currents spiking through protein ion channels. As a result of dynamically
switching their conductive states, ion channels exhibit a variety of
current-voltage nonlinearities and memory effects. Fueled by the promise of
computing architectures entirely different from von Neumann, recent attempts to
identify and harness similar phenomena in artificial nanofluidic environments
focused on demonstrating analog circuit elements with memory. Here we explore
aqueous ionic transport through two-dimensional (2D) membranes featuring arrays
of ion-trapping crown-ether-like pores. We demonstrate that for aqueous salts
featuring ions with different ion-pore binding affinities, memristive effects
emerge through coupling between the time-delayed state of the system and its
transport properties. We also demonstrate a nanopore array that behaves as a
capacitor with a strain-tunable built-in barrier, yielding behaviors ranging
from current spiking to ohmic response. By focusing on the illustrative
underlying mechanisms, we demonstrate that realistically observable memory
effects may be achieved in nanofluidic systems featuring crown-porous 2D
membranes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning plays an important and growing role in molecular simulation.
The newest version of the OpenMM molecular dynamics toolkit introduces new
features to support the use of machine learning potentials. Arbitrary PyTorch
models can be added to a simulation and used to compute forces and energy. A
higher-level interface allows users to easily model their molecules of interest
with general purpose, pretrained potential functions. A collection of optimized
CUDA kernels and custom PyTorch operations greatly improves the speed of
simulations. We demonstrate these features on simulations of cyclin-dependent
kinase 8 (CDK8) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore in water.
Taken together, these features make it practical to use machine learning to
improve the accuracy of simulations at only a modest increase in cost.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) over text representations can be effective for
finding high-value policies that can search over graphs. However, RL requires
careful structuring of the search space and algorithm design to be effective in
this challenge. Through extensive experiments, we explore how different design
choices for text grammar and algorithmic choices for training can affect an RL
policy's ability to generate molecules with desired properties. We arrive at a
new RL-based molecular design algorithm (ChemRLformer) and perform a thorough
analysis using 25 molecule design tasks, including computationally complex
protein docking simulations. From this analysis, we discover unique insights in
this problem space and show that ChemRLformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being more straightforward than prior work by demystifying
which design choices are actually helpful for text-based molecule design.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the stability and performance of transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents in online settings, specifically in molecular optimization tasks. The authors observe that transformers can be unstable during training, leading to suboptimal performance. They investigate the reasons for this instability and propose several solutions to address it.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Prior to this paper, the state-of-the-art in transformer-based RL agents for molecular optimization tasks was achieved by Parisotto et al.'s work [Parisotto et al., 2019], which used an online reinforcement learning algorithm. The authors of this paper improve upon this result by proposing several solutions to address the instability of transformers in online RL, including replay buffers, likelihood penalization, and KL regularization with a prior.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments on the augmented docking task to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed solutions. They trained both transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN) based RL agents for 10 times more molecules and compared their performance. They also compared their results with another RL algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 12-16 and Table 1 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 12 compares the performance of transformer and RNN based agents on augmented docking tasks, while Figure 13 compares their results with another RL algorithm, PPO. Table 1 provides a summary of their proposed solutions to address the instability of transformers in online RL.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites [Schulman et al., 2017] and [Cieplinski et al., 2021] the most frequently, both of which are related to complex algorithms like PPO. They mention that these algorithms have achieved higher performance on control tasks, but their results indicate that vanilla policy gradient algorithms are more stable than actor critic algorithms like PPO for molecular optimization tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it addresses a critical challenge in transformer-based RL agents, which are their instability and suboptimal performance in online settings. By proposing several solutions to address this issue, the authors provide a new perspective on how to improve the stability and performance of transformers in molecular optimization tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on transformer-based RL agents for molecular optimization tasks, without considering other types of RL algorithms or hybrid approaches. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed solutions' computational complexity and scalability, which could be an important consideration for practical applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The need to use a short time step is a key limit on the speed of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations governed by classical potentials are
often accelerated by using a multiple-time-step (MTS) integrator that evaluates
certain potential energy terms that vary more slowly than others less
frequently. This approach is enabled by the simple but limiting analytic forms
of classical potentials. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), in
particular recent equivariant neural networks, are much more broadly applicable
than classical potentials and can faithfully reproduce the expensive but
accurate reference electronic structure calculations used to train them. They
still, however, require the use of a single short time step, as they lack the
inherent term-by-term scale separation of classical potentials. This work
introduces a method to learn a scale separation in complex interatomic
interactions by co-training two MLIPs. Initially, a small and efficient model
is trained to reproduce short-time-scale interactions. Subsequently, a large
and expressive model is trained jointly to capture the remaining interactions
not captured by the small model. When running MD, the MTS integrator then
evaluates the smaller model for every time step and the larger model less
frequently, accelerating simulation. Compared to a conventionally trained MLIP,
our approach can achieve a significant speedup (~3x in our experiments) without
a loss of accuracy on the potential energy or simulation-derived quantities.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of scaling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to large systems, particularly those with millions of atoms, by developing a novel machine learning (ML) framework called MTS-Allegro. The authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional MD methods, which can be computationally expensive and challenging to scale for large systems, by leveraging the power of ML to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, the previous state of the art in MD simulations for large systems involved using Gaussian approximation potental (GAP) or density functional theory (DFT) to approximate the potential energy surface. However, these methods are limited in their accuracy and applicability, especially for systems with complex interactions. The paper improves upon this state of the art by introducing MTS-Allegro, which combines the advantages of ML and classical MD simulations to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in large-scale simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments using MTS-Allegro to demonstrate its capabilities and compare it with traditional MD methods. They applied MTS-Allegro to several systems, including liquid water, hydrogen peroxide, and a protein-ligand complex, and compared the results with those obtained using classical MD simulations and other ML methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 4, as well as Tables 2 and 3, are referenced frequently throughout the paper. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of MTS-Allegro, while Figure 2 compares the performance of MTS-Allegro with other ML methods for a liquid system. Table 2 provides the hyperparameters used for Allegro and the outer model, while Table 3 lists the hyperparameters for the inner model of MTS-Allegro.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to MD simulations, ML methods, and potential energy surfaces. One of the most frequently cited references is the work by P. J. Stephens et al. on the use of ML for molecular dynamics simulations [3]. The authors also cite works by A. M. G. Prendergast et al. on the development of Gaussian approximation potental [4] and by J. C. Sipe et al. on the use of ML for protein structure prediction [5]. These citations are given in the context of discussing the limitations of traditional MD methods and the potential advantages of using ML to improve their accuracy and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that MTS-Allegro has the potential to revolutionize the field of molecular simulations by enabling large-scale simulations of complex systems that were previously inaccessible. This could lead to significant advances in fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and environmental modeling. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the versatility and power of ML methods in combination with classical MD simulations, which could pave the way for new applications and hybrid approaches in various scientific domains.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the development and application of MTS-Allegro to MD simulations, without providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance compared to other ML methods or classical MD simulations. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MTS-Allegro, which could be an important factor in practical applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The paper does not provide a direct Github repository link. However, the authors mention that their code and data are available on request from the corresponding author, and they encourage interested readers to reach out to them for more information.</p>
