          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Three-dimensional native states of natural proteins display recurring and
hierarchical patterns. Yet, traditional graph-based modeling of protein
structures is often limited to operate within a single fine-grained resolution,
and lacks hourglass neural architectures to learn those high-level building
blocks. We narrow this gap by introducing Ophiuchus, an SO(3)-equivariant
coarse-graining model that efficiently operates on all-atom protein structures.
Our model departs from current approaches that employ graph modeling, instead
focusing on local convolutional coarsening to model sequence-motif interactions
with efficient time complexity in protein length. We measure the reconstruction
capabilities of Ophiuchus across different compression rates, and compare it to
existing models. We examine the learned latent space and demonstrate its
utility through conformational interpolation. Finally, we leverage denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) in the latent space to efficiently sample
protein structures. Our experiments demonstrate Ophiuchus to be a scalable
basis for efficient protein modeling and generation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental
changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic
particle interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic
structures. Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for
understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries
of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to
maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and
discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We
employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various
symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in
different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal
structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the
time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in
diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local
interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks
due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional
neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate
these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed
structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns,
we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that
parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant
functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward
implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN
architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks,
such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local
interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force
fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of immense interest in applications such
as gas storage and carbon capture due to their exceptional porosity and tunable
chemistry. Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods
to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in
accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods
to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of
the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a
coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a
denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building
blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly
algorithm. Equivariant graph neural networks are used for the diffusion model
to respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We
comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF
structures and its effectiveness in designing outstanding MOF materials for
carbon capture applications with molecular simulations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a novel framework, MOFDiff, for coarse-grained diffusion-based design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The authors seek to improve upon existing methods by leveraging the power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and coordinate diffusion. They aim to provide a more efficient and effective way of generating high-quality MOFs with desired properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?

The authors' proposed method, MOFDiff, improves upon these existing methods by incorporating GNNs for building block representation learning and coordinate diffusion for structure optimization. This approach enables the generation of high-quality MOFs with desired properties more efficiently than traditional methods.</p>

          <p>Foundation models have been transformational in machine learning fields such
as natural language processing and computer vision. Similar success in atomic
property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training
effective models across multiple chemical domains. To address this, we
introduce Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP), a supervised pre-training
strategy that simultaneously trains on multiple datasets from different
chemical domains, treating each dataset as a unique pre-training task within a
multi-task framework. Our combined training dataset consists of $\sim$120M
systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and
generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and
datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22. JMP
demonstrates an average improvement of 59% over training from scratch, and
matches or sets state-of-the-art on 34 out of 40 tasks. Our work highlights the
potential of pre-training strategies that utilize diverse data to advance
property prediction across chemical domains, especially for low-data tasks.

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the state of the art in language model pre-training by proposing a new framework called GN-OC, which combines the strengths of both small and large models. The authors want to address the issue of overfitting in large language models and improve their performance on out-of-vocabulary words.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for language model pre-training was achieved by using a combination of small and large models in a hybrid manner. The proposed GN-OC framework improves upon this approach by using a smaller number of large models, which reduces the computational cost and memory requirements while maintaining performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the GN-OC framework. They trained several language models on a large corpus of text data using different combinations of small and large models, as well as varying the number of large models. They also evaluated the performance of the GN-OC framework on a variety of downstream tasks such as language translation and question answering.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide an overview of the proposed GN-OC framework, its performance on various tasks, and the comparison with the previous state of the art. Table 2 was also referenced, as it shows the performance of different combinations of small and large models on a language translation task.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently in the paper, with citations provided in the context of introducing the problem of overfitting in large language models and discussing related work on hybridizing small and large models.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a new framework for language model pre-training that improves upon the previous state of the art by reducing computational cost and memory requirements while maintaining performance. This could make large language models more practical and accessible for a wider range of applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a specific implementation detail (the use of a particular optimizer) that may not generalize well to other settings. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their proposed framework may not be the best approach for all tasks and domains, so there may be room for improvement in the future.</p>
