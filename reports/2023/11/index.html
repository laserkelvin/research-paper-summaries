          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present Symphony, an $E(3)$-equivariant autoregressive generative model
for 3D molecular geometries that iteratively builds a molecule from molecular
fragments. Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for
molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries
of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree
$E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability
distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D
geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate
small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive
models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a method for generating diverse molecular structures with desired properties, specifically focusing on the trade-off between validity and uniqueness of generated molecules.

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that previous methods for generating molecular structures, such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been successful in improving validity but suffer from a lack of diversity or uniqueness in the generated samples. They improve upon these methods by proposing a new approach that combines EAs with GANs to generate diverse and valid molecular structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to evaluate the performance of their method, including testing it on different types of molecules and comparing its results to those obtained using previous state-of-the-art methods.

          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 15 and 16, and Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 15 shows the trade-off between validity and uniqueness of generated molecules as a function of temperature applied to the focus or position distribution logits, while Figure 16 displays random non-cherry-picked samples from Symphony.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metallic alloys often form phases - known as solid solutions - in which
chemical elements are spread out on the same crystal lattice in an almost
random manner. The tendency of certain chemical motifs to be more common than
others is known as chemical short-range order (SRO) and it has received
substantial consideration in alloys with multiple chemical elements present in
large concentrations due to their extreme configurational complexity (e.g.,
high-entropy alloys). Short-range order renders solid solutions "slightly less
random than completely random", which is a physically intuitive picture, but
not easily quantifiable due to the sheer number of possible chemical motifs and
their subtle spatial distribution on the lattice. Here we present a multiscale
method to predict and quantify the SRO state of an alloy with atomic
resolution, incorporating machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between
electronic-structure calculations and the characteristic length scale of SRO.
The result is an approach capable of predicting SRO length scale in agreement
with experimental measurements while comprehensively correlating SRO with
fundamental quantities such as local lattice distortions. This work advances
the quantitative understanding of solid-solution phases, paving the way for SRO
rigorous incorporation into predictive mechanical and thermodynamic models.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an investigation into diffusion models for molecular generation,
with the aim of better understanding how their predictions compare to the
results of physics-based calculations. The investigation into these models is
driven by their potential to significantly accelerate electronic structure
calculations using machine learning, without requiring expensive
first-principles datasets for training interatomic potentials. We find that the
inference process of a popular diffusion model for de novo molecular generation
is divided into an exploration phase, where the model chooses the atomic
species, and a relaxation phase, where it adjusts the atomic coordinates to
find a low-energy geometry. As training proceeds, we show that the model
initially learns about the first-order structure of the potential energy
surface, and then later learns about higher-order structure. We also find that
the relaxation phase of the diffusion model can be re-purposed to sample the
Boltzmann distribution over conformations and to carry out structure
relaxations. For structure relaxations, the model finds geometries with ~10x
lower energy than those produced by a classical force field for small organic
molecules. Initializing a density functional theory (DFT) relaxation at the
diffusion-produced structures yields a >2x speedup to the DFT relaxation when
compared to initializing at structures relaxed with a classical force field.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New methods for carbon dioxide removal are urgently needed to combat global
climate change. Direct air capture (DAC) is an emerging technology to capture
carbon dioxide directly from ambient air. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have
been widely studied as potentially customizable adsorbents for DAC. However,
discovering promising MOF sorbents for DAC is challenging because of the vast
chemical space to explore and the need to understand materials as functions of
humidity and temperature. We explore a computational approach benefiting from
recent innovations in machine learning (ML) and present a dataset named Open
DAC 2023 (ODAC23) consisting of more than 38M density functional theory (DFT)
calculations on more than 8,400 MOF materials containing adsorbed $CO_2$ and/or
$H_2O$. ODAC23 is by far the largest dataset of MOF adsorption calculations at
the DFT level of accuracy currently available. In addition to probing
properties of adsorbed molecules, the dataset is a rich source of information
on structural relaxation of MOFs, which will be useful in many contexts beyond
specific applications for DAC. A large number of MOFs with promising properties
for DAC are identified directly in ODAC23. We also trained state-of-the-art ML
models on this dataset to approximate calculations at the DFT level. This
open-source dataset and our initial ML models will provide an important
baseline for future efforts to identify MOFs for a wide range of applications,
including DAC.</p>
