          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and
without stellar feedback, magnetic fields, and driven turbulence, to study the
compression and expansion rates of the gas as functions of density. We show
that, around the mean density, supersonic turbulence promotes rough equilibrium
between the amounts of compressing and expanding gas, consistent with
continuous gas cycling between high and low density states. We find that the
inclusion of protostellar jets produces rapidly expanding and compressing
low-density gas. We find that the gas mass flux peaks at the transition between
the lognormal and power-law forms of the density probability distribution
function (PDF). This is consistent with the transition density tracking the
post-shock density, which promotes an enhancement of mass at this density
(i.e., shock compression and filament formation). At high densities, the gas
dynamics are dominated by self-gravity: the compression rate in all of our runs
matches the rate of the run with only gravity, suggesting that processes other
than self-gravity have little effect at these densities. The net gas mass flux
becomes constant at a density below the sink formation threshold, where it
equals the star formation rate. The density at which the net gas mass flux
equals the star formation rate is one order of magnitude lower than our sink
threshold density, corresponds to the formation of the second power-law tail in
the density PDF, and sets the overall star formation rates of these
simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Using data from the GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting for Aromatic
Molecules) survey, we report the first astronomical detection of the C10H-
anion. The astronomical observations also provided the necessary data to refine
the spectroscopic parameters of C10H-. From the velocity stacked data and the
matched filter response, C10H- is detected at >9{\sigma} confidence level at a
column density of 4.04e11 cm-2. A dedicated search for the C10H radical was
also conducted towards TMC-1. In this case, the stacked molecular emission of
C10H was detected at a ~3.2{\sigma} confidence interval at a column density of
2.02e11 cm-2. However, since the determined confidence level is currently
<5{\sigma}, we consider the identification of C10H as tentative. The full
GOTHAM dataset was also used to better characterize the physical parameters
including column density, excitation temperature, linewidth, and source size
for the C4H, C6H and C8H radicals and their respective anions, and the measured
column densities were compared to the predictions from a gas/grain chemical
formation model and from a machine learning analysis. Given the measured
values, the C10H-/C10H column density ratio is ~2.0 - the highest value
measured between an anion and neutral species to date. Such a high ratio is at
odds with current theories for interstellar anion chemistry. For the radical
species, both models can reproduce the measured abundances found from the
survey; however, the machine learning analysis matches the detected anion
abundances much better than the gas/grain chemical model, suggesting that the
current understanding of the formation chemistry of molecular anions is still
highly uncertain.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a comprehensive study of the cyanopolyyne chemistry in the
prototypical prestellar core L1544. Using the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT) we observe 3 emission lines of HC$_3$N, 9 lines of HC$_5$N, 5
lines of HC$_7$N, and 9 lines of HC$_9$N. HC$_9$N is detected for the first
time towards the source. The high spectral resolution ($\sim$ 0.05 km s$^{-1}$)
reveals double-peak spectral line profiles with the redshifted peak a factor
3-5 brighter. Resolved maps of the core in other molecular tracers indicates
that the southern region is redshifted. Therefore, the bulk of the cyanopolyyne
emission is likely associated with the southern region of the core, where free
carbon atoms are available to form long chains, thanks to the more efficient
illumination of the interstellar field radiation.
  We perform a simultaneous modelling of the HC$_5$N, HC$_7$N, and HC$_9$N
lines, to investigate the origin of the emission. To enable this analysis, we
performed new calculation of the collisional coefficients. The simultaneous
fitting indicates a gas kinetic temperature of 5--12 K, a source size of
80$\arcsec$, and a gas density larger than 100 cm$^{-3}$. The
HC$_5$N:HC$_7$N:HC$_9$N abundance ratios measured in L1544 are about 1:6:4. We
compare our observations with those towards the the well-studied starless core
TMC-1 and with the available measurements in different star-forming regions.
The comparison suggests that a complex carbon chain chemistry is active in
other sources and it is related to the presence of free gaseous carbon.
Finally, we discuss the possible formation and destruction routes in the light
of the new observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir of the volatile elements that link
chemical processes in dark, interstellar clouds with the formation of planets
and composition of their atmospheres. The initial ice composition is set in the
cold, dense parts of molecular clouds, prior to the onset of star formation.
With the exquisite sensitivity of JWST, this critical stage of ice evolution is
now accessible for detailed study. Here we show the first results of the Early
Release Science program "Ice Age" that reveal the rich composition of these
dense cloud ices. Weak ices, including, $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, $^{13}$CO, OCS,
and COMs functional groups are now detected along two pre-stellar lines of
sight. The $^{12}$CO$_2$ ice profile indicates modest growth of the icy grains.
Column densities of the major and minor ice species indicate that ices
contribute between 2 and 19% of the bulk budgets of the key C, O, N, and S
elements. Our results suggest that the formation of simple and complex
molecules could begin early in a water-ice rich environment.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this study, we introduce a training protocol for developing machine
learning force fields (MLFFs), capable of accurately determining energy
barriers in catalytic reaction pathways. The protocol is validated on the
extensively explored hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol over indium
oxide. With the help of active learning, the final force field obtains energy
barriers within 0.05 eV of Density Functional Theory. Thanks to the
computational speedup, not only do we reduce the cost of routine in-silico
catalytic tasks, but also find a 40\% reduction in the previously established
rate-limiting step. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of
finite-temperature effects and compute free energy barriers. The
transferability of the protocol is demonstrated on the experimentally relevant,
yet unexplored, top-layer reduced indium oxide surface. The ability of MLFFs to
enhance our understanding of extensively studied catalysts underscores the need
for fast and accurate alternatives to direct ab-intio simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Launched on 12 Aug. 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe had completed 13 of its
scheduled 24 orbits around the Sun by Nov. 2022. The mission's primary science
goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic
field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and
determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe
returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality,
significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of
discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four
years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar
minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28
Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e.,
sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind, which is one of the mission's primary objectives. In
this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly
during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well
beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that
heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the
structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the
solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic
particles.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Propyl cyanide (PrCN) (C3H7CN) with both linear and branched isomers is
ubiquitous in interstellar space and is important for astrochemistry as it is
one of the most complex molecules found to date in the interstellar medium.
Furthermore, it is the only one observed species to share the branched atomic
backbone of amino acids, some of the building blocks of life. Radical-radical
chemical reactions are examined in detail using density functional theory,
second order M{\phi}ller Plesset perturbation theory, coupled cluster methods,
and the energy resolved master equation formalism to compute the rate constants
in the low pressure limit prevalent in the ISM. Quantum chemical studies are
reported for the formation of propyl-cyanide (n-PrCN) and its branched isomer
(iso-PrCN) from the gas phase association and surface reactions of radicals on
a 34-water model ice cluster. We identify two and three paths for the formation
of iso-PrCN, and n-PrCN respectively. The reaction mechanism involves the
following radicals association: CH3CHCH3+CN, CH3+CH3CHCN for iso-PrCN formation
and CH3CH2+CH2CN, CH3+CH2CH2CN, CN+CH3CH2CH2 leading to n-PrCN formation. We
employ the M062X/6-311++G(d,p) DFT functional and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ for reactions
on the ice model, and gas phase respectively to optimize the structures,
compute minimum energy paths and zero-point vibrational energies of all
reaction mechanisms. In gas phase, the energetics of the five reactions are
also calculated using the explicitly correlated cluster ab initio methods
(CCSD(T)-F12). All reaction paths are exoergic and barrier-less in gas phase
and on the ice-model suggesting that the formation of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN is
efficient on the water-ice model adopted in this paper. The gas phase formation
of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN however requires a third body or spontaneous emission of
a photon in order to stabilize the molecules.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) based approaches have emerged as
a powerful technique to encode complex topological structure of crystal
materials in an enriched representation space. These models are often
supervised in nature and using the property-specific training data, learn
relationship between crystal structure and different properties like formation
energy, bandgap, bulk modulus, etc. Most of these methods require a huge amount
of property-tagged data to train the system which may not be available for
different properties. However, there is an availability of a huge amount of
crystal data with its chemical composition and structural bonds. To leverage
these untapped data, this paper presents CrysGNN, a new pre-trained GNN
framework for crystalline materials, which captures both node and graph level
structural information of crystal graphs using a huge amount of unlabelled
material data. Further, we extract distilled knowledge from CrysGNN and inject
into different state of the art property predictors to enhance their property
prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments to show that with
distilled knowledge from the pre-trained model, all the SOTA algorithms are
able to outperform their own vanilla version with good margins. We also observe
that the distillation process provides a significant improvement over the
conventional approach of finetuning the pre-trained model. We have released the
pre-trained model along with the large dataset of 800K crystal graph which we
carefully curated; so that the pretrained model can be plugged into any
existing and upcoming models to enhance their prediction accuracy.</p>
