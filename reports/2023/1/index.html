          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and
without stellar feedback, magnetic fields, and driven turbulence, to study the
compression and expansion rates of the gas as functions of density. We show
that, around the mean density, supersonic turbulence promotes rough equilibrium
between the amounts of compressing and expanding gas, consistent with
continuous gas cycling between high and low density states. We find that the
inclusion of protostellar jets produces rapidly expanding and compressing
low-density gas. We find that the gas mass flux peaks at the transition between
the lognormal and power-law forms of the density probability distribution
function (PDF). This is consistent with the transition density tracking the
post-shock density, which promotes an enhancement of mass at this density
(i.e., shock compression and filament formation). At high densities, the gas
dynamics are dominated by self-gravity: the compression rate in all of our runs
matches the rate of the run with only gravity, suggesting that processes other
than self-gravity have little effect at these densities. The net gas mass flux
becomes constant at a density below the sink formation threshold, where it
equals the star formation rate. The density at which the net gas mass flux
equals the star formation rate is one order of magnitude lower than our sink
threshold density, corresponds to the formation of the second power-law tail in
the density PDF, and sets the overall star formation rates of these
simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Using data from the GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting for Aromatic
Molecules) survey, we report the first astronomical detection of the C10H-
anion. The astronomical observations also provided the necessary data to refine
the spectroscopic parameters of C10H-. From the velocity stacked data and the
matched filter response, C10H- is detected at >9{\sigma} confidence level at a
column density of 4.04e11 cm-2. A dedicated search for the C10H radical was
also conducted towards TMC-1. In this case, the stacked molecular emission of
C10H was detected at a ~3.2{\sigma} confidence interval at a column density of
2.02e11 cm-2. However, since the determined confidence level is currently
<5{\sigma}, we consider the identification of C10H as tentative. The full
GOTHAM dataset was also used to better characterize the physical parameters
including column density, excitation temperature, linewidth, and source size
for the C4H, C6H and C8H radicals and their respective anions, and the measured
column densities were compared to the predictions from a gas/grain chemical
formation model and from a machine learning analysis. Given the measured
values, the C10H-/C10H column density ratio is ~2.0 - the highest value
measured between an anion and neutral species to date. Such a high ratio is at
odds with current theories for interstellar anion chemistry. For the radical
species, both models can reproduce the measured abundances found from the
survey; however, the machine learning analysis matches the detected anion
abundances much better than the gas/grain chemical model, suggesting that the
current understanding of the formation chemistry of molecular anions is still
highly uncertain.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors are attempting to model the time-dependence of gas-phase abundances within the nautilus chemical models in relation to observed values, specifically for carbon chains with 4-10 atoms. They aim to improve upon previous studies by incorporating a more accurate representation of the chemical processes involved.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in nautilus chemical models for carbon chains was limited by simplifications and assumptions that neglected important chemical processes, leading to unrealistic abundance predictions. This paper improves upon these models by incorporating a more detailed treatment of chemical reactions and isotopic fractionation, allowing for a more accurate representation of the time-dependence of gas-phase abundances.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed nautilus chemical model simulations using a range of carbon chain lengths to compare with observed abundance values. They also used previous studies' age estimates for TMC-1, which is a molecular cloud in the Milky Way galaxy, as a reference point for their models.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures I1 and II2, as well as Table 3, were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure I1 shows the time-dependence of simulated abundances within the nautilus chemical models in relation to observed values, while Figure II2 displays the column densities of the CnN and CnH– families as a function of carbon chain length. Table 3 lists the ages and abundance ratios for TMC-1 from various studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [2] by Siebert et al. was cited the most frequently, as it provides a previous age estimate for TMC-1 that is used as a reference point in the present study. The authors also cite [3] and [4] to provide context for their model assumptions and comparisons with observed abundances.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of molecular clouds, such as TMC-1, by providing a more accurate representation of the time-dependence of gas-phase abundances. This could lead to a better understanding of the role of chemistry in shaping the structure and composition of these environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their models assume a fixed isotopic composition for carbon, which may not be accurate. They also note that their results are sensitive to the choice of input parameters, such as the ionization fraction and the rate constants of chemical reactions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a comprehensive study of the cyanopolyyne chemistry in the
prototypical prestellar core L1544. Using the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT) we observe 3 emission lines of HC$_3$N, 9 lines of HC$_5$N, 5
lines of HC$_7$N, and 9 lines of HC$_9$N. HC$_9$N is detected for the first
time towards the source. The high spectral resolution ($\sim$ 0.05 km s$^{-1}$)
reveals double-peak spectral line profiles with the redshifted peak a factor
3-5 brighter. Resolved maps of the core in other molecular tracers indicates
that the southern region is redshifted. Therefore, the bulk of the cyanopolyyne
emission is likely associated with the southern region of the core, where free
carbon atoms are available to form long chains, thanks to the more efficient
illumination of the interstellar field radiation.
  We perform a simultaneous modelling of the HC$_5$N, HC$_7$N, and HC$_9$N
lines, to investigate the origin of the emission. To enable this analysis, we
performed new calculation of the collisional coefficients. The simultaneous
fitting indicates a gas kinetic temperature of 5--12 K, a source size of
80$\arcsec$, and a gas density larger than 100 cm$^{-3}$. The
HC$_5$N:HC$_7$N:HC$_9$N abundance ratios measured in L1544 are about 1:6:4. We
compare our observations with those towards the the well-studied starless core
TMC-1 and with the available measurements in different star-forming regions.
The comparison suggests that a complex carbon chain chemistry is active in
other sources and it is related to the presence of free gaseous carbon.
Finally, we discuss the possible formation and destruction routes in the light
of the new observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir of the volatile elements that link
chemical processes in dark, interstellar clouds with the formation of planets
and composition of their atmospheres. The initial ice composition is set in the
cold, dense parts of molecular clouds, prior to the onset of star formation.
With the exquisite sensitivity of JWST, this critical stage of ice evolution is
now accessible for detailed study. Here we show the first results of the Early
Release Science program "Ice Age" that reveal the rich composition of these
dense cloud ices. Weak ices, including, $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, $^{13}$CO, OCS,
and COMs functional groups are now detected along two pre-stellar lines of
sight. The $^{12}$CO$_2$ ice profile indicates modest growth of the icy grains.
Column densities of the major and minor ice species indicate that ices
contribute between 2 and 19% of the bulk budgets of the key C, O, N, and S
elements. Our results suggest that the formation of simple and complex
molecules could begin early in a water-ice rich environment.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the column densities of various ices, including H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, NH3, CH4, 13CO, 13CO2, OCN, NH+4, OCS, and SO2, in the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM) using data from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Herschel Space Observatory. They are trying to improve upon previous estimates of ice column densities by developing a new method that accounts for the non-LTE excitation of ices in the ISM.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have used global fitting techniques to estimate ice column densities, but these methods are limited by their assumption of LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) excitation. The authors' new method, which uses local fits to the observed spectra, improves upon previous estimates by accounting for non-LTE excitation and providing more accurate column density estimates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of ISO and Herschel data to observe the spectral features of various ices in the ISM. They developed a new method for fitting the observed spectra to determine ice column densities, and applied this method to a set of known ice mixtures to validate its accuracy.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed spectra of various ices in the ISM, while Table 1 provides a summary of the ice column densities derived from the local fits. Figure 3 compares the column densities obtained using global and local fitting techniques, and Table 2 lists the references cited in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Boogert et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the ice composition of the ISM. The authors also cite [2] by Noble et al., which presents a global fitting method for estimating ice column densities in the ISM.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper's proposed method for estimating ice column densities could lead to more accurate estimates of the composition of the ISM, which is important for understanding the chemical evolution of the galaxy and the origins of the solar system. Additionally, the use of local fits to observed spectra allows for a more detailed analysis of the excitation properties of individual ices, providing valuable insights into their formation and destruction processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on simplified assumptions about the ice composition and the ISM, which could limit its accuracy. Additionally, they note that the observed spectra may be affected by unaccounted-for complexities, such as non-LTE excitation of other ices or the presence of intervening dust.</p>
