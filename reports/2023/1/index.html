          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and
without stellar feedback, magnetic fields, and driven turbulence, to study the
compression and expansion rates of the gas as functions of density. We show
that, around the mean density, supersonic turbulence promotes rough equilibrium
between the amounts of compressing and expanding gas, consistent with
continuous gas cycling between high and low density states. We find that the
inclusion of protostellar jets produces rapidly expanding and compressing
low-density gas. We find that the gas mass flux peaks at the transition between
the lognormal and power-law forms of the density probability distribution
function (PDF). This is consistent with the transition density tracking the
post-shock density, which promotes an enhancement of mass at this density
(i.e., shock compression and filament formation). At high densities, the gas
dynamics are dominated by self-gravity: the compression rate in all of our runs
matches the rate of the run with only gravity, suggesting that processes other
than self-gravity have little effect at these densities. The net gas mass flux
becomes constant at a density below the sink formation threshold, where it
equals the star formation rate. The density at which the net gas mass flux
equals the star formation rate is one order of magnitude lower than our sink
threshold density, corresponds to the formation of the second power-law tail in
the density PDF, and sets the overall star formation rates of these
simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Using data from the GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting for Aromatic
Molecules) survey, we report the first astronomical detection of the C10H-
anion. The astronomical observations also provided the necessary data to refine
the spectroscopic parameters of C10H-. From the velocity stacked data and the
matched filter response, C10H- is detected at >9{\sigma} confidence level at a
column density of 4.04e11 cm-2. A dedicated search for the C10H radical was
also conducted towards TMC-1. In this case, the stacked molecular emission of
C10H was detected at a ~3.2{\sigma} confidence interval at a column density of
2.02e11 cm-2. However, since the determined confidence level is currently
<5{\sigma}, we consider the identification of C10H as tentative. The full
GOTHAM dataset was also used to better characterize the physical parameters
including column density, excitation temperature, linewidth, and source size
for the C4H, C6H and C8H radicals and their respective anions, and the measured
column densities were compared to the predictions from a gas/grain chemical
formation model and from a machine learning analysis. Given the measured
values, the C10H-/C10H column density ratio is ~2.0 - the highest value
measured between an anion and neutral species to date. Such a high ratio is at
odds with current theories for interstellar anion chemistry. For the radical
species, both models can reproduce the measured abundances found from the
survey; however, the machine learning analysis matches the detected anion
abundances much better than the gas/grain chemical model, suggesting that the
current understanding of the formation chemistry of molecular anions is still
highly uncertain.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a comprehensive study of the cyanopolyyne chemistry in the
prototypical prestellar core L1544. Using the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT) we observe 3 emission lines of HC$_3$N, 9 lines of HC$_5$N, 5
lines of HC$_7$N, and 9 lines of HC$_9$N. HC$_9$N is detected for the first
time towards the source. The high spectral resolution ($\sim$ 0.05 km s$^{-1}$)
reveals double-peak spectral line profiles with the redshifted peak a factor
3-5 brighter. Resolved maps of the core in other molecular tracers indicates
that the southern region is redshifted. Therefore, the bulk of the cyanopolyyne
emission is likely associated with the southern region of the core, where free
carbon atoms are available to form long chains, thanks to the more efficient
illumination of the interstellar field radiation.
  We perform a simultaneous modelling of the HC$_5$N, HC$_7$N, and HC$_9$N
lines, to investigate the origin of the emission. To enable this analysis, we
performed new calculation of the collisional coefficients. The simultaneous
fitting indicates a gas kinetic temperature of 5--12 K, a source size of
80$\arcsec$, and a gas density larger than 100 cm$^{-3}$. The
HC$_5$N:HC$_7$N:HC$_9$N abundance ratios measured in L1544 are about 1:6:4. We
compare our observations with those towards the the well-studied starless core
TMC-1 and with the available measurements in different star-forming regions.
The comparison suggests that a complex carbon chain chemistry is active in
other sources and it is related to the presence of free gaseous carbon.
Finally, we discuss the possible formation and destruction routes in the light
of the new observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir of the volatile elements that link
chemical processes in dark, interstellar clouds with the formation of planets
and composition of their atmospheres. The initial ice composition is set in the
cold, dense parts of molecular clouds, prior to the onset of star formation.
With the exquisite sensitivity of JWST, this critical stage of ice evolution is
now accessible for detailed study. Here we show the first results of the Early
Release Science program "Ice Age" that reveal the rich composition of these
dense cloud ices. Weak ices, including, $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, $^{13}$CO, OCS,
and COMs functional groups are now detected along two pre-stellar lines of
sight. The $^{12}$CO$_2$ ice profile indicates modest growth of the icy grains.
Column densities of the major and minor ice species indicate that ices
contribute between 2 and 19% of the bulk budgets of the key C, O, N, and S
elements. Our results suggest that the formation of simple and complex
molecules could begin early in a water-ice rich environment.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this study, we introduce a training protocol for developing machine
learning force fields (MLFFs), capable of accurately determining energy
barriers in catalytic reaction pathways. The protocol is validated on the
extensively explored hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol over indium
oxide. With the help of active learning, the final force field obtains energy
barriers within 0.05 eV of Density Functional Theory. Thanks to the
computational speedup, not only do we reduce the cost of routine in-silico
catalytic tasks, but also find a 40\% reduction in the previously established
rate-limiting step. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of
finite-temperature effects and compute free energy barriers. The
transferability of the protocol is demonstrated on the experimentally relevant,
yet unexplored, top-layer reduced indium oxide surface. The ability of MLFFs to
enhance our understanding of extensively studied catalysts underscores the need
for fast and accurate alternatives to direct ab-intio simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Launched on 12 Aug. 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe had completed 13 of its
scheduled 24 orbits around the Sun by Nov. 2022. The mission's primary science
goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic
field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and
determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe
returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality,
significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of
discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four
years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar
minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28
Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e.,
sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind, which is one of the mission's primary objectives. In
this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly
during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well
beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that
heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the
structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the
solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic
particles.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Propyl cyanide (PrCN) (C3H7CN) with both linear and branched isomers is
ubiquitous in interstellar space and is important for astrochemistry as it is
one of the most complex molecules found to date in the interstellar medium.
Furthermore, it is the only one observed species to share the branched atomic
backbone of amino acids, some of the building blocks of life. Radical-radical
chemical reactions are examined in detail using density functional theory,
second order M{\phi}ller Plesset perturbation theory, coupled cluster methods,
and the energy resolved master equation formalism to compute the rate constants
in the low pressure limit prevalent in the ISM. Quantum chemical studies are
reported for the formation of propyl-cyanide (n-PrCN) and its branched isomer
(iso-PrCN) from the gas phase association and surface reactions of radicals on
a 34-water model ice cluster. We identify two and three paths for the formation
of iso-PrCN, and n-PrCN respectively. The reaction mechanism involves the
following radicals association: CH3CHCH3+CN, CH3+CH3CHCN for iso-PrCN formation
and CH3CH2+CH2CN, CH3+CH2CH2CN, CN+CH3CH2CH2 leading to n-PrCN formation. We
employ the M062X/6-311++G(d,p) DFT functional and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ for reactions
on the ice model, and gas phase respectively to optimize the structures,
compute minimum energy paths and zero-point vibrational energies of all
reaction mechanisms. In gas phase, the energetics of the five reactions are
also calculated using the explicitly correlated cluster ab initio methods
(CCSD(T)-F12). All reaction paths are exoergic and barrier-less in gas phase
and on the ice-model suggesting that the formation of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN is
efficient on the water-ice model adopted in this paper. The gas phase formation
of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN however requires a third body or spontaneous emission of
a photon in order to stabilize the molecules.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) based approaches have emerged as
a powerful technique to encode complex topological structure of crystal
materials in an enriched representation space. These models are often
supervised in nature and using the property-specific training data, learn
relationship between crystal structure and different properties like formation
energy, bandgap, bulk modulus, etc. Most of these methods require a huge amount
of property-tagged data to train the system which may not be available for
different properties. However, there is an availability of a huge amount of
crystal data with its chemical composition and structural bonds. To leverage
these untapped data, this paper presents CrysGNN, a new pre-trained GNN
framework for crystalline materials, which captures both node and graph level
structural information of crystal graphs using a huge amount of unlabelled
material data. Further, we extract distilled knowledge from CrysGNN and inject
into different state of the art property predictors to enhance their property
prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments to show that with
distilled knowledge from the pre-trained model, all the SOTA algorithms are
able to outperform their own vanilla version with good margins. We also observe
that the distillation process provides a significant improvement over the
conventional approach of finetuning the pre-trained model. We have released the
pre-trained model along with the large dataset of 800K crystal graph which we
carefully curated; so that the pretrained model can be plugged into any
existing and upcoming models to enhance their prediction accuracy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The organic chemistry occurring in interstellar environments may lead to the
production of complex molecules that are relevant to the emergence of life.
Therefore, in order to understand the origins of life itself, it is necessary
to probe the chemistry of carbon-bearing molecules under conditions that
simulate interstellar space. Several of these regions, such as dense molecular
cores, are exposed to ionizing radiation in the form of galactic cosmic rays,
which may act as an important driver of molecular destruction and synthesis. In
this paper, we report the results of a comparative and systematic study of the
irradiation of CH4:H2O ice mixtures by 1 MeV protons and 2 keV electrons at 20
K.We demonstrate that our irradiations result in the formation of a number of
new products, including both simple and complex daughter molecules such as
C2H6, C3H8, C2H2, CH3OH, CO, CO2, and probably also H2CO. A comparison of the
different irradiation regimes has also revealed that proton irradiation
resulted in a greater abundance of radiolytic daughter molecules compared to
electron irradiation, despite a lower radiation dose having been administered.
These results are important in the context of the radiation astrochemistry
occurring within the molecular cores of dense interstellar clouds, as well as
on outer Solar System objects.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context. High latitude molecular clouds (hereafter HLMCs) permit the study of
interstellar gas dynamics and astrochemistry with good accuracy due to their
proximity, generally clear lines of sight, and lack of internal star-forming
activity which can heavily modify the physical context. MBM 40, one of the
nearest HLMCs, has been extensively studied, making it a superb target to infer
and study the dust-to-gas mixing ratio (DGMR).
  Aims. The mixing of dust and gas in the interstellar medium remains a
fundamental issue to keep track of astrochemistry evolution and molecular
abundances. Accounting for both molecular and atomic gas is difficult because
$H_2$ is not directly observable and HI spectra always show different dynamical
profiles blended together which are not directly correlated with the cloud. We
used two independent strategies to infer the molecular and atomic gas column
densities and compute the dust-to-gas mixing ratio.
  Methods. We combined $HI$ 21 cm and $^{12}CO$ line observations with the IRAS
100 $\mu$m image to infer the dust-to-gas mixing ratio within the cloud. The
cloud 21 cm profile was extracted using a hybrid Gaussian decomposition where
$^{12}CO$ was used to deduce the total molecular hydrogen column density.
Infrared images were used to calculate the dust emission.
  Results. The dust-to-gas mixing ratio is nearly uniform within the cloud as
outlined by the hairpin structure. The total hydrogen column density and 100
$\mu$m emissivity are linearly correlated over a range in $N(H_{tot})$ of one
order of magnitude.</p>

The Planck satellite provides higher resolution and sensitivity, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the dust temperature structure within the cloud.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used the Planck satellite data to study the dust temperature structure of MBM 40. They integrated the dust emission over the line of sight and modeled the spectral energy distribution to determine the unique temperature for each pixel. They also used the velocity analysis to isolate the dust emission from the cloud.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 9 and 10 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the DGMR correlation and the dust temperature structure of MBM 40, respectively. Table 3 is also important, as it lists the parameters used to describe the Planck data.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The $F_{10.7cm}$ radio flux and the Sunspot Number are the most widely used
long-term indices of solar activity. They are strongly correlated, which led to
the publication of many proxy relations allowing to convert one index onto the
other. However, those existing proxies show significant disagreements, in
particular at low solar activity. Our aim is to bring a global clarification of
those many issues. We compute new polynomial regressions up to degree 4, in
order to obtain a more accurate proxy. We also study the role of temporal
averaging on the regression, and we investigate the issue of the all-quiet
$F_{10.7}$ background flux. Finally, we check for any change in the $F_{10.7}$
-- sunspot number relation over the entire period 1947 -- 2015. We find that,
with a $4^{th}$-degree polynomial, we obtain a more accurate proxy relation
than all previous published ones, and we derive a formula giving standard
errors. The relation is different for daily, monthly and yearly mean values,
and it proves to be fully linear for raw non-averaged daily data. By a simple
two-component model for daily values, we show how temporal averaging leads to
non-linear proxy relations. We also show that the quiet-Sun $F_{10.7}$
background is not absolute and actually depends on the duration of the spotless
periods. Finally, we find that the $F_{10.7cm}$ time series is inhomogeneous,
with an abrupt 10.5% upward jump occurring between 1980 and 1981. Our new proxy
relations show the importance of temporal scale for choosing the appropriate
proxy and the $F_{10.7}$ quiet-Sun background level. From historical evidence,
we conclude that the 1981 jump is most likely due to a unique change in the
$F_{10.7}$ scientific team and the data processing, and that the newly
re-calibrated sunspot number (version2) will probably provide the only possible
reference to correct this inhomogeneity.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the discovery of an Earth-mass planet ($M_b\sin i =
1.26\pm0.21M_\oplus$) on a 15.6d orbit of a relatively nearby ($d\sim$9.6pc)
and low-mass ($0.167\pm0.011 M_\odot$) M5.0V star, Wolf 1069. Sitting at a
separation of $0.0672\pm0.0014$au away from the host star puts Wolf 1069b in
the habitable zone (HZ), receiving an incident flux of
$S=0.652\pm0.029S_\oplus$. The planetary signal was detected using
telluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph,
amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost four
years. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which we
attribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to our
photometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergone
with the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., from
MEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of
$P_{rot}=150-170$d, with a likely value at $169.3^{+3.7}_{-3.6}$d. The stellar
activity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrate
evidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possible
factors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limits
indicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbital
periods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf
1069 b had a violent formation history. This planet is also the 6th closest
Earth-mass planet situated in the conservative HZ, after Proxima Centauri b, GJ
1061d, Teegarden's Star c, and GJ 1002 b and c. Despite not transiting, Wolf
1069b is nonetheless a very promising target for future three-dimensional
climate models to investigate various habitability cases as well as for
sub-ms$^{-1}$ RV campaigns to search for potential inner sub-Earth-mass planets
in order to test planet formation theories.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Terrestrial exoplanets in habitable zones are ubiquitous. It is, however,
unknown which have Earth-like or Venus-like climates. Distinguishing different
planet-types is crucial for determining whether a planet could be habitable. We
investigate the potential of polarimetry for distinguishing exo-Earths from
exo-Venuses. We present computed fluxes and polarisation of starlight that is
reflected by exoplanets with atmospheres in evolutionary states from current
Earth to current Venus, with cloud compositions ranging from pure water to 0.75
sulfuric acid solution, for wavelengths between 0.3 and 2.5 microns. The
polarisation of the reflected light shows larger variations with the planetary
phase angle than the total flux. Across the visible, the largest polarisation
is reached for an Earth-like atmosphere with water clouds, due to Rayleigh
scattering above the clouds and the rainbow near 40 deg phase angle. In the
near-infrared, the planet with a Venus-like CO2 atmosphere and thin water
clouds shows the most prominent polarisation features due to scattering by the
small cloud droplets. A planet around Alpha Centauri A would leave temporal
variations on the order of 10E-13 W/m3 in the reflected flux and 10E-11 in the
degree of polarisation along the planet's orbit for a spatially unresolved
star-planet system. Star-planet contrasts are on the order of 10E-10. Current
polarimeters cannot distinguish between the possible evolutionary phases of
spatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets, as a sensitivity near 10E-10 is
required to discern the planet signal on the background of unpolarised
starlight. Telescopes capable of reaching planet-star contrasts lower than
10E-9 should be able to observe the variation of the planet's resolved degree
of polarisation as a function of its phase angle and thus to discern an
exo-Earth from an exo-Venus based on its clouds' unique polarisation
signatures.</p>
