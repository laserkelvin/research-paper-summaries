          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the
time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for atomic and molecular collisions.
The algorithm is based on the $S$-matrix version of the Kohn variational
principle, which computes the fundamental scattering $S$-matrix by inverting
the Hamiltonian matrix expressed in the basis of square-integrable functions.
The computational bottleneck of the classical algorithm -- symmetric matrix
inversion -- is addressed here using the variational quantum linear solver
(VQLS), a recently developed noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithm
for solving systems of linear equations. We apply our algorithm to single and
multichannel quantum scattering problems, obtaining accurate vibrational
relaxation probabilities in collinear atom-molecule collisions. We also show
how the algorithm could be scaled up to simulate collisions of large polyatomic
molecules. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to calculate scattering
cross sections and rates for complex molecular collisions on NISQ quantum
processors, opening up the possibility of scalable digital quantum computation
of gas-phase bimolecular collisions and reactions of relevance to
astrochemistry and ultracold chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Water freezing is ubiquitous on Earth, affecting many areas from biology to
climate science and aviation technology. Probing the atomic structure in the
homogeneous ice nucleation process from scratch is of great value but still
experimentally unachievable. Theoretical simulations have found that ice
originates from the low-mobile region with increasing abundance and persistence
of tetrahedrally coordinated water molecules. However, a detailed microscopic
picture of how the disordered hydrogen-bond network rearranges itself into an
ordered network is still unclear. In this work, we use a deep neural network
(DNN) model to "learn" the interatomic potential energy from quantum mechanical
data, thereby allowing for large-scale and long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with ab initio accuracy. The nucleation mechanism and dynamics at
atomic resolution, represented by a total of 36 $\mu$s-long MD trajectories,
are deeply affected by the structural and dynamical heterogeneity in
supercooled water. We find that imperfectly coordinated (IC) water molecules
with high mobility pave the way for hydrogen-bond network rearrangement,
leading to the growth or shrinkage of the ice nucleus. The hydrogen-bond
network formed by perfectly coordinated (PC) molecules stabilizes the nucleus,
thus preventing it from vanishing and growing. Consequently, ice is born
through competition and cooperation between IC and PC molecules. We anticipate
that our picture of the microscopic mechanism of ice nucleation will provide
new insights into many properties of water and other relevant materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal halide perovskites are multifunctional semiconductors with tunable
structures and properties. They are highly dynamic crystals with complex
octahedral tilting patterns and strongly anharmonic atomic behaviour. In the
higher temperature, higher symmetry phases of these materials, several complex
structural features have been observed. The local structure can differ greatly
from the average structure and there is evidence that dynamic two-dimensional
structures of correlated octahedral motion form. An understanding of the
underlying complex atomistic dynamics is, however, still lacking. In this work,
the local structure of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI$_3$ is investigated using
a new machine learning force field based on the atomic cluster expansion
framework. Through analysis of the temporal and spatial correlation observed
during large-scale simulations, we reveal that the low frequency motion of
octahedral tilts implies a double-well effective potential landscape, even well
into the cubic phase. Moreover, dynamic local regions of lower symmetry are
present within both higher symmetry phases. These regions are planar and we
report the length and timescales of the motion. Finally, we investigate and
visualise the spatial arrangement of these features and their interactions,
providing a comprehensive picture of local structure in the higher symmetry
phases.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to understand the mechanism of tilted nucleation in a 2D potential landscape and investigate how it evolves with temperature. They seek to answer why the time-averaged tilts remain multimodal far above the transition temperature, despite the system exhibiting dynamic behavior near the transition temperature.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in simulating tilted nucleation in 2D potential landscapes was limited to low-dimensional systems, and there were no studies that investigated the evolution of tilts with temperature. This paper presents a 2D simulation of tilted nucleation and explores the effect of temperature on the time-averaged tilts, providing new insights into the mechanism of tilted nucleation.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed Monte Carlo simulations of a 2D potential landscape with tunable anisotropy and temperature. They evaluated the distribution of tilts at different temperatures and observed the time evolution of the tilts.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures S2 and S3 are mentioned frequently in the text, as they show the 2D joint distributions of tilting angles and a slice through the full 3D distribution at θz = 0, respectively. These figures provide important information on the distribution of tilts at different temperatures.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Fransson et al. is cited several times throughout the paper, particularly when discussing the previous state of the art and the methodology used in the simulation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides new insights into the mechanism of tilted nucleation in 2D potential landscapes, which can help to improve our understanding of this phenomenon in various fields such as materials science and biophysics. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering the temperature effect on the time-averaged tilts, which can have significant implications for the design of materials with tailored properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the simulation is limited to a 2D potential landscape, which may not capture all aspects of tilted nucleation in higher-dimensional systems. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their methodology assumes a uniform anisotropy, which may not be applicable to all potential landscapes.</p>

          <p>Disordered rocksalt Li-excess (DRX) compounds are attractive new cathode
materials for Li-ion batteries as they contain resource-abundant metals and do
not require the use of cobalt or nickel. Understanding the delithiation process
and cation short-range ordering (SRO) in DRX compounds is essential to
improving these promising cathode materials. Herein, we use first-principles
calculations along with the cluster-expansion approach to model the disorder in
DRX Li2-xVO3, 0 < x < 1. We discuss the SRO of Li in tetrahedral and octahedral
sites, and the order in which Li delithiates and V oxidizes with respect to
local environments. We reveal that the number of nearest-neighbor V dictates
the order of delithiation from octahedral sites and that V are oxidized in a
manner that minimizes the electrostatic interactions among V. Our results
provide valuable insight for tailoring the performance of V-based DRX cathode
materials in general by controlling the SRO features that reduce energy
density.</p>

          <p>To aid in the automation of inorganic materials synthesis, we introduce an
algorithm (ARROWS3) that guides the selection of precursors used in solid-state
reactions. Given a target phase, ARROWS3 iteratively proposes experiments and
learns from their outcomes to identify an optimal set of precursors that leads
to maximal yield of that target. Initial experiments are selected based on
thermochemical data collected from first principles calculations, which enable
the identification of precursors exhibiting large thermodynamic force to form
the desired target. Should the initial experiments fail, their associated
reaction paths are determined by sampling a range of synthesis temperatures and
identifying their products. ARROWS3 then uses this information to pinpoint
which intermediate reactions consume most of the available free energy
associated with the starting materials. In subsequent experimental iterations,
precursors are selected to avoid such unfavorable reactions and therefore
maintain a strong driving force to form the target. We validate this approach
on three experimental datasets containing results from more than 200 distinct
synthesis procedures. When compared to several black-box optimization
algorithms, ARROWS3 identifies the most effective set of precursors for each
target while requiring substantially fewer experimental iterations. These
findings highlight the importance of using domain knowledge in the design of
optimization algorithms for materials synthesis, which are critical for the
development of fully autonomous research platforms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The properties of lithium metal are key parameters in the design of lithium
ion and lithium metal batteries. They are difficult to probe experimentally due
to the high reactivity and low melting point of lithium as well as the
microscopic scales at which lithium exists in batteries where it is found to
have enhanced strength, with implications for dendrite suppression strategies.
Computationally, there is a lack of empirical potentials that are consistently
quantitatively accurate across all properties and ab-initio calculations are
too costly. In this work, we train Machine Learning Interaction Potentials
(MLIPs) on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to state-of-the-art accuracy in
reproducing experimental and ab-initio results across a wide range of
simulations at large length and time scales. We accurately predict
thermodynamic properties, phonon spectra, temperature dependence of elastic
constants and various surface properties inaccessible using DFT. We establish
that there exists a Bell-Evans-Polanyi relation correlating the self-adsorption
energy and the minimum surface diffusion barrier for high Miller index facets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This work brings the leading accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness of
deep equivariant neural networks to the extreme computational scale. This is
achieved through a combination of innovative model architecture, massive
parallelization, and models and implementations optimized for efficient GPU
utilization. The resulting Allegro architecture bridges the accuracy-speed
tradeoff of atomistic simulations and enables description of dynamics in
structures of unprecedented complexity at quantum fidelity. To illustrate the
scalability of Allegro, we perform nanoseconds-long stable simulations of
protein dynamics and scale up to a 44-million atom structure of a complete,
all-atom, explicitly solvated HIV capsid on the Perlmutter supercomputer. We
demonstrate excellent strong scaling up to 100 million atoms and 70% weak
scaling to 5120 A100 GPUs.</p>
