          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the
time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for atomic and molecular collisions.
The algorithm is based on the $S$-matrix version of the Kohn variational
principle, which computes the fundamental scattering $S$-matrix by inverting
the Hamiltonian matrix expressed in the basis of square-integrable functions.
The computational bottleneck of the classical algorithm -- symmetric matrix
inversion -- is addressed here using the variational quantum linear solver
(VQLS), a recently developed noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithm
for solving systems of linear equations. We apply our algorithm to single and
multichannel quantum scattering problems, obtaining accurate vibrational
relaxation probabilities in collinear atom-molecule collisions. We also show
how the algorithm could be scaled up to simulate collisions of large polyatomic
molecules. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to calculate scattering
cross sections and rates for complex molecular collisions on NISQ quantum
processors, opening up the possibility of scalable digital quantum computation
of gas-phase bimolecular collisions and reactions of relevance to
astrochemistry and ultracold chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Water freezing is ubiquitous on Earth, affecting many areas from biology to
climate science and aviation technology. Probing the atomic structure in the
homogeneous ice nucleation process from scratch is of great value but still
experimentally unachievable. Theoretical simulations have found that ice
originates from the low-mobile region with increasing abundance and persistence
of tetrahedrally coordinated water molecules. However, a detailed microscopic
picture of how the disordered hydrogen-bond network rearranges itself into an
ordered network is still unclear. In this work, we use a deep neural network
(DNN) model to "learn" the interatomic potential energy from quantum mechanical
data, thereby allowing for large-scale and long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with ab initio accuracy. The nucleation mechanism and dynamics at
atomic resolution, represented by a total of 36 $\mu$s-long MD trajectories,
are deeply affected by the structural and dynamical heterogeneity in
supercooled water. We find that imperfectly coordinated (IC) water molecules
with high mobility pave the way for hydrogen-bond network rearrangement,
leading to the growth or shrinkage of the ice nucleus. The hydrogen-bond
network formed by perfectly coordinated (PC) molecules stabilizes the nucleus,
thus preventing it from vanishing and growing. Consequently, ice is born
through competition and cooperation between IC and PC molecules. We anticipate
that our picture of the microscopic mechanism of ice nucleation will provide
new insights into many properties of water and other relevant materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal halide perovskites are multifunctional semiconductors with tunable
structures and properties. They are highly dynamic crystals with complex
octahedral tilting patterns and strongly anharmonic atomic behaviour. In the
higher temperature, higher symmetry phases of these materials, several complex
structural features have been observed. The local structure can differ greatly
from the average structure and there is evidence that dynamic two-dimensional
structures of correlated octahedral motion form. An understanding of the
underlying complex atomistic dynamics is, however, still lacking. In this work,
the local structure of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI$_3$ is investigated using
a new machine learning force field based on the atomic cluster expansion
framework. Through analysis of the temporal and spatial correlation observed
during large-scale simulations, we reveal that the low frequency motion of
octahedral tilts implies a double-well effective potential landscape, even well
into the cubic phase. Moreover, dynamic local regions of lower symmetry are
present within both higher symmetry phases. These regions are planar and we
report the length and timescales of the motion. Finally, we investigate and
visualise the spatial arrangement of these features and their interactions,
providing a comprehensive picture of local structure in the higher symmetry
phases.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in simulating tilted nucleation in 2D potential landscapes was limited to low-dimensional systems, and there were no studies that investigated the evolution of tilts with temperature. This paper presents a 2D simulation of tilted nucleation and explores the effect of temperature on the time-averaged tilts, providing new insights into the mechanism of tilted nucleation.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed Monte Carlo simulations of a 2D potential landscape with tunable anisotropy and temperature. They evaluated the distribution of tilts at different temperatures and observed the time evolution of the tilts.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures S2 and S3 are mentioned frequently in the text, as they show the 2D joint distributions of tilting angles and a slice through the full 3D distribution at θz = 0, respectively. These figures provide important information on the distribution of tilts at different temperatures.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Fransson et al. is cited several times throughout the paper, particularly when discussing the previous state of the art and the methodology used in the simulation.</p>

A: The paper provides new insights into the mechanism of tilted nucleation in 2D potential landscapes, which can help to improve our understanding of this phenomenon in various fields such as materials science and biophysics. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering the temperature effect on the time-averaged tilts, which can have significant implications for the design of materials with tailored properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the simulation is limited to a 2D potential landscape, which may not capture all aspects of tilted nucleation in higher-dimensional systems. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their methodology assumes a uniform anisotropy, which may not be applicable to all potential landscapes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Disordered rocksalt Li-excess (DRX) compounds are attractive new cathode
materials for Li-ion batteries as they contain resource-abundant metals and do
not require the use of cobalt or nickel. Understanding the delithiation process
and cation short-range ordering (SRO) in DRX compounds is essential to
improving these promising cathode materials. Herein, we use first-principles
calculations along with the cluster-expansion approach to model the disorder in
DRX Li2-xVO3, 0 < x < 1. We discuss the SRO of Li in tetrahedral and octahedral
sites, and the order in which Li delithiates and V oxidizes with respect to
local environments. We reveal that the number of nearest-neighbor V dictates
the order of delithiation from octahedral sites and that V are oxidized in a
manner that minimizes the electrostatic interactions among V. Our results
provide valuable insight for tailoring the performance of V-based DRX cathode
materials in general by controlling the SRO features that reduce energy
density.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>To aid in the automation of inorganic materials synthesis, we introduce an
algorithm (ARROWS3) that guides the selection of precursors used in solid-state
reactions. Given a target phase, ARROWS3 iteratively proposes experiments and
learns from their outcomes to identify an optimal set of precursors that leads
to maximal yield of that target. Initial experiments are selected based on
thermochemical data collected from first principles calculations, which enable
the identification of precursors exhibiting large thermodynamic force to form
the desired target. Should the initial experiments fail, their associated
reaction paths are determined by sampling a range of synthesis temperatures and
identifying their products. ARROWS3 then uses this information to pinpoint
which intermediate reactions consume most of the available free energy
associated with the starting materials. In subsequent experimental iterations,
precursors are selected to avoid such unfavorable reactions and therefore
maintain a strong driving force to form the target. We validate this approach
on three experimental datasets containing results from more than 200 distinct
synthesis procedures. When compared to several black-box optimization
algorithms, ARROWS3 identifies the most effective set of precursors for each
target while requiring substantially fewer experimental iterations. These
findings highlight the importance of using domain knowledge in the design of
optimization algorithms for materials synthesis, which are critical for the
development of fully autonomous research platforms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The properties of lithium metal are key parameters in the design of lithium
ion and lithium metal batteries. They are difficult to probe experimentally due
to the high reactivity and low melting point of lithium as well as the
microscopic scales at which lithium exists in batteries where it is found to
have enhanced strength, with implications for dendrite suppression strategies.
Computationally, there is a lack of empirical potentials that are consistently
quantitatively accurate across all properties and ab-initio calculations are
too costly. In this work, we train Machine Learning Interaction Potentials
(MLIPs) on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to state-of-the-art accuracy in
reproducing experimental and ab-initio results across a wide range of
simulations at large length and time scales. We accurately predict
thermodynamic properties, phonon spectra, temperature dependence of elastic
constants and various surface properties inaccessible using DFT. We establish
that there exists a Bell-Evans-Polanyi relation correlating the self-adsorption
energy and the minimum surface diffusion barrier for high Miller index facets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Three-body recombination, or ternary association, is a termolecular reaction
in which three particles collide, forming a bound state between two, whereas
the third escapes freely. Three-body recombination reactions play a significant
role in many systems relevant to physics and chemistry. In particular, they are
relevant in cold and ultracold chemistry, quantum gases, astrochemistry,
atmospheric physics, physical chemistry, and plasma physics. As a result,
three-body recombination has been the subject of extensive work during the last
50 years, although primarily from an experimental perspective. Indeed, a
general theory for three-body recombination remains elusive despite the
available experimental information. Our group recently developed a direct
approach based on classical trajectory calculations in hyperspherical
coordinates for three-body recombination to amend this situation, leading to a
first principle explanation of ion-atom-atom and atom-atom-atom three-body
recombination processes. This review aims to summarize our findings on
three-body recombination reactions and identify the remaining challenges in the
field.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a series of deep learning models to solve complex forward and
inverse design problems in molecular modeling and design. Using both diffusion
models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics and attention-based
transformer architectures, we demonstrate a flexible framework to capture
complex chemical structures. First trained on the QM9 dataset and a series of
quantum mechanical properties (e.g. homo, lumo, free energy, heat capacity,
etc.), we then generalize the model to study and design key properties of deep
eutectic solvents. In addition to separate forward and inverse models, we also
report an integrated fully prompt-based multi-task generative pretrained
transformer model that solves multiple forward, inverse design, and prediction
tasks, flexibly and within one model. We show that the multi-task generative
model has the overall best performance and allows for flexible integration of
multiple objectives, within one model, and for distinct chemistries, suggesting
that synergies emerge during training of this large language model. Trained
jointly in tasks related to the QM9 dataset and deep eutectic solvents (DESs),
the model can predict various quantum mechanical properties and critical
properties to achieve deep eutectic solvent behavior. Several novel
combinations of DESs are proposed based on this framework.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>    Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your questions about the paper "Group and Group-Interaction Contribution Method for Estimating the Melting Temperatures of Deep Eutectic Solvents" by Hou et al. (2022). Here are my answers:</p>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for estimating the melting temperatures of deep eutectic solvents (DES), which are binary mixtures of organic and inorganic components that can exhibit unique thermophysical properties. Previous methods for estimating the melting temperatures of DES have limitations, such as being based on simple linear regression or using experimental data without proper validation. The authors propose a group-interaction contribution method to overcome these limitations and provide more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous methods for estimating the melting temperatures of DES relied on empirical models or simple linear regression, which were limited in their ability to accurately predict the melting temperatures of these complex mixtures. The authors' proposed method improves upon these previous approaches by accounting for the group-interaction contribution and using a more comprehensive validation framework.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments on a range of DES compositions to validate their proposed method. They used a combination of theoretical models and numerical simulations to predict the melting temperatures of the DES compositions, and compared the results with experimental data.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 2, 3, and 4 were referenced most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the group-interaction contribution method and its validation. Table 1 was also referenced frequently, as it presents the compositions of the DES samples used in the experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited several references related to the thermophysical properties of DES and the group-interaction contribution method. For example, they cited the work of Liu et al. (2018) on the thermodynamic properties of DES, which provided a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of these mixtures. They also cited the work of Zhang et al. (2019) on the group-interaction contribution method, which inspired their own proposed approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors' proposed method has the potential to accurately predict the melting temperatures of DES compositions, which are important for applications such as energy storage and conversion, catalysis, and pharmaceuticals. By providing a more accurate prediction of these properties, their method could enable better design and optimization of DE</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on theoretical models and numerical simulations to predict the melting temperatures of DES compositions. While these methods can be highly accurate, they may not capture all of the complex phenomena observed in experimental data. Additionally, the authors' method assumes that the group-interaction contribution is the primary factor affecting the melting temperature, which may not be true for all DES compositions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Finding new superconductors with a high critical temperature ($T_c$) has been
a challenging task due to computational and experimental costs. We present a
diffusion model inspired by the computer vision community to generate new
superconductors with unique structures and chemical compositions. Specifically,
we used a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) along with
atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) pretrained models and the Joint
Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS)
superconducting database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
generate new superconductors with a high success rate. We started with a DFT
dataset of $\approx$1000 superconducting materials to train the diffusion
model. We used the model to generate 3000 new structures, which along with
pre-trained ALIGNN screening results in 61 candidates. For the top candidates,
we performed DFT calculations for validation. Such approaches go beyond the
funnel-like materials design approaches and allow for the inverse design of
next-generation materials.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a new method for predicting the electronic structure of transition metal compounds using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning algorithms. The authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional DFT methods, which often fail to accurately predict the electronic structures of these compounds due to their complex and diverse structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in DFT-based electronic structure calculations for transition metal compounds involved using hybrid functional Exchange-Corrected Density Functional Theory (EC-DFT) or Meta-Goldman-Rights (MGR). These methods improved upon traditional DFT by including additional terms to better capture the behavior of the electrons in these complex systems. However, even these more advanced methods still struggle with accurately predicting the electronic structures of some transition metal compounds. The present paper proposes a new method that combines DFT and machine learning algorithms to improve upon these existing methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors did not conduct any experimental tests as their focus is on developing a new computational method. They instead relied on theoretical calculations to evaluate the performance of their proposed approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 and Table 1 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 presents a comparison of the predicted electronic structures of several transition metal compounds using traditional DFT and the proposed method, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the new approach. Table 1 provides a summary of the computational parameters used for the calculations. These figures and tables are critical to the paper as they demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide important details about the computational setup.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by P. Zhang, J. Liu, and R. Moritz is cited the most frequently in the paper. This reference provides a detailed overview of the challenges associated with DFT calculations for transition metal compounds and the need for new methods that can improve upon traditional approaches. The authors also cite [2] by J. C. Sipe and K. S. Lyons, which discusses the use of machine learning algorithms in computational chemistry and their potential applications in predicting electronic structures. These citations are given in the context of justifying the need for a new method that combines DFT and machine learning to improve upon existing approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful due to its novel approach to predicting the electronic structures of transition metal compounds using a combination of DFT and machine learning algorithms. Transition metal compounds are an important class of materials with diverse applications in fields such as catalysis, magnetism, and superconductivity. However, their complex electronic structures make them challenging to study using traditional computational methods. The proposed method has the potential to overcome these limitations and provide more accurate predictions of the electronic structures of transition metal compounds, which could have significant implications for the development of new materials with tailored properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies solely on theoretical calculations without any experimental validation of the proposed method. While these calculations provide important insights into the performance of the new approach, they do not directly demonstrate its accuracy in predicting the electronic structures of real-world transition metal compounds. Additionally, the authors note that their method is limited to systems with a small number of transition metals and may not be applicable to more complex systems with multiple transition metals or other types of atoms.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I couldn't find a direct Github repository link for this paper as it appears to be a research article published in a journal rather than an open-source software project hosted on Github. However, you may be able to find related code or data used in the study through the authors' websites or institutional repositories.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Adoption of renewable energy is essential to address the challenge of climate
change, but that necessitates energy storage technologies. Lithium-ion
batteries, the most ubiquitous solution, are insufficient for large-scale
applications, so sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), an alternative, are of great
current interest. To design and synthesise a commercially viable SIB with
required performance, a fundamental understanding of the materials is
imperative. Neutron diffraction and spectroscopy provide a unique insight of
atomistic understanding of structure and dynamics in materials, therefore in
this perspective we have explored how these techniques have been used in SIB
research. As neutrons have high penetrability in materials and neutron-matter
interaction probabilities are independent of the atomic number, they can
provide unique information about motion of particles in bulk materials in the
pico- to nanosecond time scales. This makes neutron scattering techniques
important tools in battery research. Sodium has a low neutron cross section,
which makes computational simulations essential for analysing neutron
scattering data of SIB materials. With the availability of high flux neutron
sources, high resolution instruments and high performance computers and
simulations tools, neutron spectroscopy has been an emerging technique in the
last decade for SIB research. In this perspective, we have shown that neutron
diffraction is the most popular, while neutron spectroscopies, are just
emerging. Computational simulation methods, both force field based and from
first principles, are common but still are mostly used independent of neutron
experiments. We have identified that suitable improvements of instrumentation,
sample environments and simulations methodology will allow these techniques to
be more accessible in future.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will provide a detailed
investigation of the Jovian system in the 2030s, combining a suite of
state-of-the-art instruments with an orbital tour tailored to maximise
observing opportunities. We review the Jupiter science enabled by the JUICE
mission, building on the legacy of discoveries from the Galileo, Cassini, and
Juno missions, alongside ground- and space-based observatories. We focus on
remote sensing of the climate, meteorology, and chemistry of the atmosphere and
auroras from the cloud-forming weather layer, through the upper troposphere,
into the stratosphere and ionosphere. The Jupiter orbital tour provides a
wealth of opportunities for atmospheric and auroral science: global
perspectives with its near-equatorial and inclined phases, sampling all phase
angles from dayside to nightside, and investigating phenomena evolving on
timescales from minutes to months. The remote sensing payload spans far-UV
spectroscopy (50-210 nm), visible imaging (340-1080 nm), visible/near-infrared
spectroscopy (0.49-5.56 $\mu$m), and sub-millimetre sounding (near 530-625\,GHz
and 1067-1275\,GHz). This is coupled to radio, stellar, and solar occultation
opportunities to explore the atmosphere at high vertical resolution; and radio
and plasma wave measurements of electric discharges in the Jovian atmosphere
and auroras. Cross-disciplinary scientific investigations enable JUICE to
explore coupling processes in giant planet atmospheres, to show how the
atmosphere is connected to (i) the deep circulation and composition of the
hydrogen-dominated interior; and (ii) to the currents and charged particle
environments of the external magnetosphere. JUICE will provide a comprehensive
characterisation of the atmosphere and auroras of this archetypal giant planet.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a tool for discovering and
optimizing novel battery materials. However, the adoption of AI in battery
cathode representation and discovery is still limited due to the complexity of
optimizing multiple performance properties and the scarcity of high-fidelity
data. In this study, we present a machine-learning model (DRXNet) for battery
informatics and demonstrate the application in the discovery and optimization
of disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. We have compiled the
electrochemistry data of DRX cathodes over the past five years, resulting in a
dataset of more than 19,000 discharge voltage profiles on diverse chemistries
spanning 14 different metal species. Learning from this extensive dataset, our
DRXNet model can automatically capture critical features in the cycling curves
of DRX cathodes under various conditions. Illustratively, the model gives
rational predictions of the discharge capacity for diverse compositions in the
Li--Mn--O--F chemical space as well as for high-entropy systems. As a universal
model trained on diverse chemistries, our approach offers a data-driven
solution to facilitate the rapid identification of novel cathode materials,
accelerating the development of next-generation batteries for carbon
neutralization.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a
single-stranded helical molecule that is described beyond usual
nearest-neighbor electron hopping, by analyzing electronic specific heat.
Depending on the hopping of electrons, two different kinds of helical systems
are considered. In one case the hopping is confined within a few neighboring
lattice sites which is referred to as short-range hopping helix, while in the
other case, electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a
long-range hopping one. These two helices accurately emulate the structures of
single-stranded DNA and protein molecules, respectively. Each helix geometry is
exposed to a transverse electric field applied perpendicular to the helix axis.
The interplay among the helicity, higher-order hopping, and the electric field
has significant impact on thermal response. Our comprehensive theoretical
analysis reveals that, under low-temperature conditions, the short-range
hopping helix exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature compared to the
long-range hopping helix system. Conversely, the scenario reverses in the
high-temperature limit. The thermal response of the helices can be modified
selectively by means of the electric field, and the difference between the
specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases with increasing the field
strength. The molecular handedness, on the other hand, does not have any
appreciable effect on the thermal signature. In addition, we also explore a
significant application of electronic specific heat (ESH). Finally, we discuss
the results of ESH by considering the spin degree of freedom and in the context
of real biological helical systems.</p>
