          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine-learned force fields have transformed the atomistic modelling of
materials by enabling simulations of ab initio quality on unprecedented time
and length scales. However, they are currently limited by: (i) the significant
computational and human effort that must go into development and validation of
potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of
transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, using the
state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML
model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable
of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate
the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times
quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences,
including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions,
interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied
out of the box and as a starting or "foundation model" for any atomistic system
of interest and is thus a step towards democratising the revolution of ML force
fields by lowering the barriers to entry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In physics, density $\rho(\cdot)$ is a fundamentally important scalar
function to model, since it describes a scalar field or a probability density
function that governs a physical process. Modeling $\rho(\cdot)$ typically
scales poorly with parameter space, however, and quickly becomes prohibitively
difficult and computationally expensive. One promising avenue to bypass this is
to leverage the capabilities of denoising diffusion models often used in
high-fidelity image generation to parameterize $\rho(\cdot)$ from existing
scientific data, from which new samples can be trivially sampled from. In this
paper, we propose $\rho$-Diffusion, an implementation of denoising diffusion
probabilistic models for multidimensional density estimation in physics, which
is currently in active development and, from our results, performs well on
physically motivated 2D and 3D density functions. Moreover, we propose a novel
hashing technique that allows $\rho$-Diffusion to be conditioned by arbitrary
amounts of physical parameters of interest.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the problem of denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) by proposing a new algorithm that improves upon the previous state of the art. DDIMs are a class of deep learning models used for image synthesis, but they suffer from noise sensitivity and difficulty in controlling the generation process.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in denoising DDIMs was a method proposed by Song et al., which used a diffusion process to remove noise from the generated images. However, this method had limitations in terms of noise sensitivity and control over the generation process. The current paper proposes a new algorithm that improves upon the previous state of the art by introducing a probabilistic framework for denoising DDIMs, which enables more accurate and controlled image synthesis.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed algorithm on various datasets and compared it to the previous state of the art method. They evaluated the quality of the generated images and measured the noise reduction capabilities of their algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5, as well as Table 1, were referenced in the text most frequently. These figures and table provide visualizations of the proposed algorithm's performance on various datasets and demonstrate its ability to reduce noise while maintaining image quality.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [30] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in denoising DDIMs and serves as a basis for comparison with the proposed algorithm. The authors also cited [19] for its contribution to the development of probabilistic frameworks for image synthesis.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful in the field of computer vision and machine learning, as it proposes a new algorithm that improves upon the previous state of the art in denoising DDIMs. This could lead to more accurate and controlled image synthesis, which could have applications in various fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

Additionally, they mention that their algorithm may have computational complexity and could benefit from further optimizations.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: I don't know. The paper does not provide a link to a Github repository containing the code for the proposed algorithm.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Materials characterization remains a labor-intensive process, with a large
amount of expert time required to post-process and analyze micrographs. As a
result, machine learning has become an essential tool in materials science,
including for materials characterization. In this study, we perform an in-depth
analysis of the prediction of crystal coverage in WSe$_2$ thin film atomic
force microscopy (AFM) height maps with supervised regression and segmentation
models. Regression models were trained from scratch and through transfer
learning from a ResNet pretrained on ImageNet and MicroNet to predict monolayer
crystal coverage. Models trained from scratch outperformed those using features
extracted from pretrained models, but fine-tuning yielded the best performance,
with an impressive 0.99 $R^2$ value on a diverse set of held-out test
micrographs. Notably, features extracted from MicroNet showed significantly
better performance than those from ImageNet, but fine-tuning on ImageNet
demonstrated the reverse. As the problem is natively a segmentation task, the
segmentation models excelled in determining crystal coverage on image patches.
However, when applied to full images rather than patches, the performance of
segmentation models degraded considerably, while the regressors did not,
suggesting that regression models may be more robust to scale and dimension
changes compared to segmentation models. Our results demonstrate the efficacy
of computer vision models for automating sample characterization in 2D
materials while providing important practical considerations for their use in
the development of chalcogenide thin films.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic
compounds such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. The origin of this
homochirality has remained a mystery for over a century. While high-energy
spin-polarized (spin-up or spin-down) electrons (SPEs) from the $\beta$ decay
of radioactive nuclei discovered by Lee and Yang (1956) and Wu et al. (1957)
have been proposed as a potential source of symmetry breaking, their exact role
on homochirality is much debated. Here we suggest magnetically aligned dust
grains as a new source of SPEs due to photoemission of electrons having aligned
spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of
strength $G_{\rm UV}$, we found that the SPE emission rate is $\Gamma_{\rm
pe}^{\rm SPE}\sim 10^{-14}G_{\rm UV}$ electrons per second per H, the fraction
of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is $\sim 10\%$, and the SPE yield
(photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach $\sim 1\%$, using the modern
theory of grain alignment. Low-energy SPEs from aligned grains would cause
chiral symmetry breaking of interstellar chiral molecules due to spin-selective
(dipole-dipole) interactions. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains
as chiral agents that facilitate and enrich the chiral asymmetry of chiral
molecules. Our proposed mechanism might explain the detection of chiral
asymmetry in the ISM, comets, and meteorites due to the ubiquitous UV radiation
and magnetically aligned grains, paving the way for understanding the origin

          <p>Agricultural production heavily exploits the soil, resulting in high erosion
in cultivated land, which poses a threat to food security and environmental
sustainability. To address this issue, we stabilize the soil using polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA). PVA strongly adheres to the soil after mixing and annealing,
enhancing the cohesive strength of the soil. The PVA-soil withstands the impact
of water at 7 m/s, protecting it from rainfall-induced erosion. Furthermore,
the water-retaining capability and drainage of PVA-soil can be adjusted based
on its sizes. This customized PVA-soil provides optimal growing conditions for
various plants in different climates. Our method contributes to improved soil
management and conversion.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new type of soil substitute made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and red soil, which maintains its discrete particle form during the drying process, indicating its inertness to water.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Classical empirical force fields have dominated biomolecular simulation for
over 50 years. Although widely used in drug discovery, crystal structure
prediction, and biomolecular dynamics, they generally lack the accuracy and
transferability required for predictive modelling. In this paper, we introduce
MACE-OFF23, a transferable force field for organic molecules created using
state-of-the-art machine learning technology and first-principles reference
data computed with a high level of quantum mechanical theory. MACE-OFF23
demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of local, short-range models by
accurately predicting a wide variety of gas and condensed phase properties of
molecular systems. It produces accurate, easy-to-converge dihedral torsion
scans of unseen molecules, as well as reliable descriptions of molecular
crystals and liquids, including quantum nuclear effects. We further demonstrate
the capabilities of MACE-OFF23 by determining free energy surfaces in explicit
solvent, as well as the folding dynamics of peptides. Finally, we simulate a
fully solvated small protein, observing accurate secondary structure and
vibrational spectrum. These developments enable first-principles simulations of
molecular systems for the broader chemistry community at high accuracy and low
computational cost.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Astrochemistry has been widely developed as a power tool to probe physical
properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in various conditions of the Milky
Way (MW) Galaxy, and in near and distant galaxies. Most current studies
conventionally apply linear scaling to all elemental abundances based on the
gas-phase metallicity. However, these elements, including carbon and oxygen,
are enriched differentially by stellar nucleosynthesis and the overall galactic
chemical evolution, evident from $\alpha$-enhancement in multiple galactic
observations such as starbursts, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, and
low-metallicity dwarfs. We perform astrochemical modeling to simulate the
impact of an $\alpha$-enhanced ISM gas cloud on the abundances of the three
phases of carbon (C$^+$, C, CO) dubbed as `the carbon cycle'. The ISM
environmental parameters considered include two cosmic-ray ionization rates
($\zeta_{\rm CR}=10^{-17}$ and $10^{-15}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$), two isotropic FUV
radiation field strengths ($\chi/\chi_0=1$ and $10^2$), and (sub-)linear
dust-to-gas relations against metallicity, mimicking the ISM conditions of
different galaxy types. In galaxies with [C/O] $<$ 0, CO, C and C$^+$ all
decrease in both abundances and emission, though with differential biases. The
low-$J$ CO emission is found to be the most stable tracer for the molecular
gas, while C and C$^+$ trace H$_2$ gas only under limited conditions, in line
with recent discoveries of [CI]-dark galaxies. We call for caution when using
[CII]~$158\mu$m and [CI](1-0) as alternative H$_2$-gas tracers for both diffuse
and dense gas with non-zero [C/O] ratios.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the impact of cosmic-ray ionization on the abundance ratios of carbon species (C+, C, and CO) in a molecular cloud environment. They seek to explore how the ionization rate affects these abundance ratios and how they can be used to infer the cosmic-ray ionization rate in extragalactic star-forming systems.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in understanding the impact of cosmic-ray ionization on carbon species abundance ratios was based on simulations that assumed a constant ionization rate for all species (Bisbas et al. 2021, 2023). This paper improves upon this by using a more realistic model that accounts for the variation in ionization rates among different species and the impact of varying environmental conditions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed simulations using the RADEX code to explore the impact of cosmic-ray ionization on C+, C, and CO abundance ratios as a function of the ionization rate and other environmental parameters such as temperature, density, and humidity. They also compared their results with observational data from the literature.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1 and B1 and Table 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure A1 shows the impact of cosmic-ray ionization on the abundance ratios of C+, C, and CO as a function of the ionization rate and other environmental parameters. Figure B1 explores how these ratios change when the molecular gas is defined as the gas with 𝑥HI ≥0.45. Table 2 presents the results of the RADEX simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference Bisbas et al. (2021, 2023) is cited the most frequently in the paper. It provides the basis for understanding the impact of cosmic-ray ionization on carbon species abundance ratios and serves as a comparison to the authors' results.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for understanding the interplay between cosmic-rays and the ISM in star-forming systems. By demonstrating that the abundance ratios of carbon species can be used to infer the cosmic-ray ionization rate, this study could provide a valuable tool for studying extragalactic environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness is that the simulations assume a certain level of accuracy in the input parameters, which may not always be the case in reality. Additionally, the study focuses solely on C+, C, and CO abundance ratios and does not explore other potential tracers of cosmic-ray ionization.</p>

          <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance across
various chemistry-related tasks. However, conventional graphs only model the
pairwise connectivity in molecules, failing to adequately represent
higher-order connections like multi-center bonds and conjugated structures. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce molecular hypergraphs and propose Molecular
Hypergraph Neural Networks (MHNN) to predict the optoelectronic properties of
organic semiconductors, where hyperedges represent conjugated structures. A
general algorithm is designed for irregular high-order connections, which can
efficiently operate on molecular hypergraphs with hyperedges of various orders.
The results show that MHNN outperforms all baseline models on most tasks of
OPV, OCELOTv1 and PCQM4Mv2 datasets. Notably, MHNN achieves this without any 3D
geometric information, surpassing the baseline model that utilizes atom
positions. Moreover, MHNN achieves better performance than pretrained GNNs
under limited training data, underscoring its excellent data efficiency. This
work provides a new strategy for more general molecular representations and
property prediction tasks related to high-order connections.</p>

A: The paper addresses a fundamental problem in GNN representation learning, leading to improved performance on node classification tasks. The attention mechanism introduced in GAT allows the model to focus on different parts of the graph simultaneously, enabling it to capture both local and global information. This could have significant implications for applications that rely on GNNs, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and drug discovery.</p>

          <p>Solid polymer electrolytes hold significant promise as materials for
next-generation batteries due to their superior safety performance, enhanced
specific energy, and extended lifespans compared to liquid electrolytes.
However, the material's low ionic conductivity impedes its commercialization,
and the vast polymer space poses significant challenges for the screening and
design. In this study, we assess the capabilities of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) for the de novo design of polymer electrolytes. To optimize
the generation, we compare different deep learning architectures, including
both GPT-based and diffusion-based models, and benchmark the results with
hyperparameter tuning. We further employ various evaluation metrics and
full-atom molecular dynamics simulations to assess the performance of different
generative model architectures and to validate the top candidates produced by
each model. Out of only 45 candidates being tested, we discovered 17 polymers
that achieve superior ionic conductivity better than any other polymers in our
database, with some of them doubling the conductivity value. In addition, by
adopting a pretraining and fine-tuning methodology, we significantly improve
the efficacy of our generative models, achieving quicker convergence, enhanced
performance with limited data, and greater diversity. Using the proposed
method, we can easily generate a large number of novel, diverse, and valid
polymers, with a chance of synthesizability, enabling us to identify promising
candidates with markedly improved efficiency.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many
different types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that
span many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular
particles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking
information include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase
transitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization,
gelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of
these systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a
temporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local
or global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide
changes marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g.
crystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters)
that are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these
reasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular
simulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions
unique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event
detection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by
scientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin,
that allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of
the system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the
simulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the
trajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event
boundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can
serve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the
application of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a
wider class of problems.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?

However, the BCP model assumes stationarity, which can be a limitation when dealing with non-stationary data. The proposed method in this paper, XSEDE, improves upon the BCP model by handling non-stationary data and providing more accurate results.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of XSEDE compared to other state-of-the-art change-point detection methods. They used real-world time series datasets and compared the results obtained using XSEDE with those obtained using the BCP model and other methods.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive
nonlinear excitations that are robust and that can be driven by external
fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and
antisolitons towards opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving
mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the
same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we
construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally
coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such
nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations -- so-called non-Hermitian skin
waves, which are typically unstable -- into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We
rationalize our observations by introducing non-reciprocal generalizations of
the Frenkel-Kontorova and sine-Gordon models, and use the latter to predict the
terminal velocity of the (anti)solitons and determine their stability. Finally,
we harness non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active
waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information.
More broadly, our findings suggest that non-reciprocal driving is a robust
mechanism to steer nonlinear waves and could be generalized beyond mechanics,
e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The variability in the magnetic activity of the Sun is the main source of the
observed changes in the plasma and electromagnetic environments within the
heliosphere. The primary way in which solar activity affects the Earth's
environment is via the solar wind and its transients. However, the relationship
between solar activity and solar wind is not the same at the Space Weather and
Space Climate time scales. In this work, we investigate this relationship
exploiting five solar cycles data of Ca II K index and solar wind parameters,
by taking advantage of the Hilbert-Huang Transform, which allows to separate
the contribution at the different time scales. By filtering out the high
frequency components and looking at decennial time scales, we confirm the
presence of a delayed response of solar wind to Ca II K index variations, with
a time lag of ~ 3.1-year for the speed and ~ 3.4-year for the dynamic pressure.
To assess the results in a stronger framework, we make use of a Transfer
Entropy approach to investigate the information flow between the quantities and
to test the causality of the relation. The time lag results from the latter are
consistent with the cross-correlation ones, pointing out the presence of a
statistical significant information flow from Ca II K index to solar wind
dynamic pressure that peaks at time lag of 3.6-year. Such a result could be of
relevance to build up a predictive model in a Space Climate context.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce a novel technique within the Nested Sampling framework to
enhance efficiency of the computation of Bayesian evidence, a critical
component in scientific data analysis. In higher dimensions, Nested Sampling
relies on Markov Chain-based likelihood-constrained prior samplers, which
generate numerous 'phantom points' during parameter space exploration. These
points are too auto-correlated to be used in the standard Nested Sampling
scheme and so are conventionally discarded, leading to waste. Our approach
discovers a way to integrate these phantom points into the evidence
calculation, thereby improving the efficiency of Nested Sampling without
sacrificing accuracy. This is achieved by ensuring the points within the live
set remain asymptotically i.i.d. uniformly distributed, allowing these points
to contribute meaningfully to the final evidence estimation. We apply our
method on several models, demonstrating substantial enhancements in sampling
efficiency, that scales well in high-dimension. Our findings suggest that this
approach can reduce the number of required likelihood evaluations by at least a
factor of 5. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the
robustness and speed of statistical analyses over a wide range of fields, from
astrophysics and cosmology to climate modelling.</p>
