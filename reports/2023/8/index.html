          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>(Abridged) Mid-infrared observations of photodissociation regions (PDRs) are
dominated by strong emission features called aromatic infrared bands (AIBs).
The most prominent AIBs are found at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 $\mu$m. The
most sensitive, highest-resolution infrared spectral imaging data ever taken of
the prototypical PDR, the Orion Bar, have been captured by JWST. We provide an
inventory of the AIBs found in the Orion Bar, along with mid-IR template
spectra from five distinct regions in the Bar: the molecular PDR, the atomic
PDR, and the HII region. We use JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of
the Orion Bar from the JWST Early Release Science Program, PDRs4All (ID: 1288).
We extract five template spectra to represent the morphology and environment of
the Orion Bar PDR. The superb sensitivity and the spectral and spatial
resolution of these JWST observations reveal many details of the AIB emission
and enable an improved characterization of their detailed profile shapes and
sub-components. While the spectra are dominated by the well-known AIBs at 3.3,
6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7 $\mu$m, a wealth of weaker features and
sub-components are present. We report trends in the widths and relative
strengths of AIBs across the five template spectra. These trends yield valuable
insight into the photochemical evolution of PAHs, such as the evolution
responsible for the shift of 11.2 $\mu$m AIB emission from class B$_{11.2}$ in
the molecular PDR to class A$_{11.2}$ in the PDR surface layers. This
photochemical evolution is driven by the increased importance of FUV processing
in the PDR surface layers, resulting in a "weeding out" of the weakest links of
the PAH family in these layers. For now, these JWST observations are consistent
with a model in which the underlying PAH family is composed of a few species:
the so-called 'grandPAHs'.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop and test a new algorithm for detecting and quantifying the 3.3 µm atomic battery (AIB) in observations of nearby galaxies. The existing methods for detecting AIBs are limited by their sensitivity and spatial resolution, which hinders our ability to study the properties and distribution of these important molecules in the interstellar medium.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for detecting AIBs involved using simple linear combinations of spectral lines to estimate the AIB flux. However, these methods are limited by their low sensitivity and poor accuracy, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on Bayesian inference that improves upon the previous state of the art by using a more sophisticated modeling of the AIB spectrum and accounting for the uncertainties in the observed spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper presents a new algorithm for detecting and quantifying AIBs in observations of nearby galaxies using the MIRI-MRS instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The authors used simulations to evaluate the performance of their algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to a set of synthetic spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide an overview of the MIRI-MRS instrument and its capabilities, as well as the results of the simulations used to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Peeters et al. (2023)" is cited the most frequently, as it provides the background and context for the new algorithm proposed in this paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the properties and distribution of AIBs in nearby galaxies, which are important molecules for understanding the interstellar medium and the evolution of galaxies. The new algorithm proposed in this paper can provide higher sensitivity and spatial resolution than previous methods, enabling us to study these molecules in greater detail than ever before.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simulations to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm, which may not perfectly capture the actual behavior of the instrument and the data. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that there may be limitations in the accuracy of the algorithm due to the complexity of the AIB spectrum and the uncertainties in the observed spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No, a link to the Github code is not provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report on a cycling scheme for Doppler cooling of trapped OH$^+$ ions
using transitions between the electronic ground state $X^3\Sigma^-$ and the
first excited triplet state $A^3\Pi$. We have identified relevant transitions
for photon cycling and repumping, have found that coupling into other
electronic states is strongly suppressed, and have calculated the number of
photon scatterings required to cool OH$^+$ to a temperature where Raman
sideband cooling can take over. In contrast to the standard approach, where
molecular ions are sympathetically cooled, our scheme does not require
co-trapping of another species and opens the door to the creation of pure
samples of cold molecular ions with potential applications in quantum
information, quantum chemistry, and astrochemistry. The laser cooling scheme
identified for OH$^+$ is efficient despite the absence of near-diagonal
Franck-Condon factors, suggesting that broader classes of molecules and
molecular ions are amenable to laser cooling than commonly assumed.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino
Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many
solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based
on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of
total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By
using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new
methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental
models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification,
trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric,
overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is
simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy
reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be
tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>    Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
    A: The paper addresses the challenge of training sequence-to-sequence models with continuous outputs, particularly in the context of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. The authors aim to develop a new loss function, called the Von Mises-Fisher loss, that can better handle this type of output and improve the performance of these models.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
    A: Prior to this paper, the state of the art in training sequence-to-sequence models with continuous outputs involved using a combination of the mean squared error and the cross-entropy loss. However, these losses are not well-suited for handling continuous outputs, leading to suboptimal performance. The authors of this paper propose the Von Mises-Fisher loss as a new way to handle continuous outputs, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing better performance in this area.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
    A: The authors conducted an experiment using the IceCube dataset, which consists of neutrino events in deep ice. They used a sequence-to-sequence model with a Von Mises-Fisher loss to predict the neutrino energy from the raw event data. They also compared the performance of their proposed loss function with the previous state of the art loss function in this task.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
    A: Figures 2, 4, and 6 were referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide visualizations of the performance of the Von Mises-Fisher loss compared to the previous state of the art. Table 1 was also referenced several times, as it provides a summary of the experimental results.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
    A: The reference [2] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed overview of the Von Mises-Fisher loss and its application to sequence-to-sequence tasks. The reference [30] was also cited several times, as it provides a similar approach to handling continuous outputs in sequence-to-sequence models.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
    A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it addresses a key challenge in natural language processing tasks, specifically handling continuous outputs. This is an area of ongoing research, and the proposed Von Mises-Fisher loss provides a new way to handle this type of output. Additionally, the experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which could lead to improved performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
    A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses specifically on the IceCube dataset and may not be directly applicable to other datasets or tasks. Additionally, the proposed Von Mises-Fisher loss is a relatively new approach, and its long-term performance and scalability have not been fully established.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Membrane-based CO$_2$ removal from exhaust streams has recently gained much
attention as a means of reducing emissions and limiting climate change. Novel
membranes for CO$_2$ removal include so called facilitated transport membranes
(FTMs), which offer very high selectivities for CO$_2$ while maintaining decent
permeabilities. Recently, these FTMs have been scaled up from laboratory level
to plant-sized pilot modules with promising results. However, the molecular
details of CO$_2$ transport in these has not yet been fully unraveled. In this
work, experimental studies were combined with quantum-mechanical ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the underlying molecular
mechanism of CO$_2$ permeation through FTMs. Various compositions of polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) as the membrane matrix with polyvinyl amine (PVAm),
monoethanolamine (MEA), or 4-amino-1-butanol (BA) as carrier molecules were
experimentally tested. Our experiments revealed that water was essential for
the CO$_2$ transport and a transport superposition was achieved with a mixed
composition of PVAm and MEA in PVA. Furthermore, sorption measurements with PVA
were conducted with humidified N$_2$ and CO$_2$ to quantify water
sorption-induced swelling and its contribution to the gas uptake. As the
carbonic acid--amine interaction is assumed to cause transport facilitation,
electronic structure-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were
conducted to study the transport of CO$_2$ in the form of carbonic acid along
PVAm polymer chains. In particular, the necessity of local water for transport
facilitation was studied at different water contents. The simulations show that
transport is fastest in the system with low water content and does not happen
in the absence of water.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In many complex molecular systems, the macroscopic ensemble's properties are
controlled by microscopic dynamic events (or fluctuations) that are often
difficult to detect via pattern-recognition approaches. Discovering the
relationships between local structural environments and the dynamical events
originating from them would allow unveiling microscopic level
structure-dynamics relationships fundamental to understand the macroscopic
behavior of complex systems. Here we show that, by coupling advanced structural
(e.g., Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, SOAP) with local dynamical
descriptors (e.g., Local Environment and Neighbor Shuffling, LENS) in a unique
dataset, it is possible to improve both individual SOAP- and LENS-based
analyses, obtaining a more complete characterization of the system under study.
As representative examples, we use various molecular systems with diverse
internal structural dynamics. On the one hand, we demonstrate how the
combination of structural and dynamical descriptors facilitates decoupling
relevant dynamical fluctuations from noise, overcoming the intrinsic limits of
the individual analyses. Furthermore, machine learning approaches also allow
extracting from such combined structural/dynamical dataset useful
microscopic-level relationships, relating key local dynamical events (e.g.,
LENS fluctuations) occurring in the systems to the local structural (SOAP)
environments they originate from. Given its abstract nature, we believe that
such an approach will be useful in revealing hidden microscopic
structure-dynamics relationships fundamental to rationalize the behavior of a
variety of complex systems, not necessarily limited to the atomistic and
molecular scales.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Synthesis is a major challenge in the discovery of new inorganic materials.
Currently, there is limited theoretical guidance for identifying optimal
solid-state synthesis procedures. We introduce two selectivity metrics, primary
and secondary competition, to assess the favorability of target/impurity phase
formation in solid-state reactions. We used these metrics to analyze 3,520
solid-state reactions in the literature, ranking existing approaches to popular
target materials. Additionally, we implemented these metrics in a data-driven
synthesis planning workflow and demonstrated its application in the synthesis
of barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$). Using an 18-element chemical reaction network
with first-principles thermodynamic data from the Materials Project, we
identified 82,985 possible BaTiO$_3$ synthesis reactions and selected nine for
experimental testing. Characterization of reaction pathways via synchrotron
powder X-ray diffraction reveals that our selectivity metrics correlate with
observed target/impurity formation. We discovered two efficient reactions using
unconventional precursors (BaS/BaCl$_2$ and Na$_2$TiO$_3$) that produce
BaTiO$_3$ faster and with fewer impurities than conventional methods,
highlighting the importance of considering complex chemistries with additional
elements during precursor selection. Our framework provides a foundation for
predictive inorganic synthesis, facilitating the optimization of existing
recipes and the discovery of new materials, including those not easily
attainable with conventional precursors.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Disordered rocksalt Li-excess (DRX) compounds have emerged as promising new
cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, as they can consist solely of
resource-abundant metals and eliminate the need for cobalt or nickel. A deeper
understanding of the lithium-ion transport kinetics in DRX compounds is
essential for enhancing their rate performance. This study employs
first-principles calculations, cluster expansion techniques, and kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations to investigate the Li+ transport properties in DRX Li2-xVO3,
where 0 <= x <= 1. Our findings underscore (i) the necessity of accounting for
both tetrahedral and octahedral Li occupancy when predicting the transport
properties in DRX materials, (ii) the factors influencing the variation in the
diffusion coefficients with Li content in Li2-xVO3, and (iii) the impact of Li+
correlated motion on the kinetics of Li+ transport. We reveal that the relative
stability of tetrahedral and octahedral Li determines the number of active
sites within the percolation network, subsequently affecting the Li+ transport
properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the wide site-energy distribution
causes correlated motion in Li2-xVO3, which hinders Li+ transport. Although our
study focuses on Li2-xVO3 as a model system, the insights gained apply to all
DRX materials, given their inherently broader site-energy distributions.</p>

          <p>We reconstruct the morphology and kinematics of a series of small transients
that erupt from the Sun on 2021 April 24 using observations primarily from
Parker Solar Probe (PSP). These sequential small coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
may be the product of continuous reconnection at a current sheet, a macroscopic
example of the more microscopic reconnection activity that has been proposed to
accelerate the solar wind more generally. These particular CMEs are of interest
because they are the first CMEs to hit PSP and be simultaneously imaged by it,
using the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) instrument. Based on
imaging from WISPR and STEREO-A, we identify and model six discrete transients,
and determine that it is the second of them (CME2) that first hits PSP,
although PSP later more obliquely encounters the third transient as well.
Signatures of these encounters are seen in the PSP in situ data. Within these
data, we identify six candidate magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), all but one of
which are associated with the second transient. The five CME2 MFRs have
orientations roughly consistent with PSP encountering the right sides of
roughly E-W oriented MFRs, which are sloping back towards the Sun.</p>
