          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Intermediate and massive stars drive fast and powerful isotropic winds that
interact with the winds of nearby stars in star clusters and the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). Wind-ISM collisions generate astrospheres around
these stars that contain hot $T\sim 10^7$ K gas that adiabatically expands. As
individual bubbles expand and collide they become unstable, potentially driving
turbulence in star clusters. In this paper we use hydrodynamic simulations to
model a densely populated young star cluster within a homogeneous cloud to
study stellar wind collisions with the surrounding ISM. We model a
mass-segregated cluster of 20 B-type young main sequence stars with masses
ranging from 3--17 $M_{\odot}$. We evolve the winds for $\sim$11 kyrs and show
that wind-ISM collisions and over-lapping wind-blown bubbles around B-stars
mixes the hot gas and ISM material generating Kolmogorov-like turbulence on
small scales early in its evolution. We discuss how turbulence driven by
stellar winds may impact the subsequent generation of star formation in the
cluster</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar feedback in the form of radiation pressure and magnetically-driven
collimated outflows may limit the maximum mass that a star can achieve and
affect the star-formation efficiency of massive pre-stellar cores. Here we
present a series of 3D adaptive mesh refinement radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the collapse of initially turbulent, massive pre-stellar cores.
Our simulations include radiative feedback from both the direct stellar and
dust-reprocessed radiation fields, and collimated outflow feedback from the
accreting stars. We find that protostellar outflows punches holes in the dusty
circumstellar gas along the star's polar directions, thereby increasing the
size of optically thin regions through which radiation can escape. Precession
of the outflows as the star's spin axis changes due to the turbulent accretion
flow further broadens the outflow, and causes more material to be entrained.
Additionally, the presence of magnetic fields in the entrained material leads
to broader entrained outflows that escape the core. We compare the injected and
entrained outflow properties and find that the entrained outflow mass is a
factor of $\sim$3 larger than the injected mass and the momentum and energy
contained in the entrained material are $\sim$25% and $\sim$5% of the injected
momentum and energy, respectively. As a result, we find that, when one includes
both outflows and radiation pressure, the former are a much more effective and
important feedback mechanism, even for massive stars with significant radiative
outputs.</p>

A: The paper aims to investigate the relationship between the density and size of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, and how it affects the growth of planets. The authors want to determine if there is a critical size below which dust grains cannot grow due to gravitational instability, and what are the implications for planet formation.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have shown that dust growth in protoplanetary disks is affected by the size and density of the dust grains, but there was no consensus on the exact relationship between these factors. This paper improves upon previous work by using a combination of analytical models and numerical simulations to investigate the effect of dust grain size on their growth in more detail.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks with variable dust grain sizes and densities. They also used analytical models to study the gravitational instability of dust grains.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5, and tables 2 and 4 were referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures and tables show the results of the simulations and analytical models, including the growth of dust grains, their size distribution, and the effect of gravitational instability on their growth.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is [Shu et al. 1988], which is mentioned several times throughout the paper as a basis for their simulations and analytical models. The authors also cite [Weingartner & Draine 2001] to discuss the effect of dust grain size on their growth.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have implications for our understanding of planet formation and the conditions under which planets can form around other stars. If there is a critical size below which dust grains cannot grow due to gravitational instability, this could limit the size range of planets that can form in protoplanetary disks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simplified models and assumptions, which may not accurately represent the complex physics of dust growth and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, the authors note that their simulations do not include the effect of magnetic fields, which could potentially affect dust grain growth.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Dust is an essential component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays an
important role in many different astrophysical processes and phenomena.
Traditionally, dust grains are known to be destroyed by thermal sublimation,
Coulomb explosions, sputtering, and shattering. The first two mechanisms arise
from the interaction of dust with intense radiation fields and high-energy
photons (extreme UV), which work in a limited astrophysical environment. The
present review is focused on a new destruction mechanism present in the {\it
dust-radiation interaction} that is effective in a wide range of radiation
fields and has ubiquitous applications in astrophysics. We first describe this
new mechanism of grain destruction, namely rotational disruption induced by
Radiative Torques (RATs) or RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We then discuss
rotational disruption of nanoparticles by mechanical torques due to supersonic
motion of grains relative to the ambient gas, which is termed MEchanical Torque
Disruption (METD). These two new mechanisms modify properties of dust and ice
(e.g., size distribution and mass), which affects observational properties,
including dust extinction, thermal and nonthermal emission, and polarization.
We present various applications of the RATD and METD mechanisms for different
environments, including the ISM, star-forming regions, astrophysical
transients, and surface astrochemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>There is mounting evidence that the composition and structure of planetary
systems are intimately linked to their birth environments. During the past
decade, several spectral surveys probed the chemistry of the earliest stages of
star formation and of late planet-forming disks. However, very little is known
about the chemistry of intermediate protostellar stages, i.e. Class I Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs), where planet formation may have already begun. We
present here the first results of a 3mm spectral survey performed with the
IRAM-30m telescope to investigate the chemistry of a sample of seven Class I
YSOs located in the Taurus star-forming region. These sources were selected to
embrace the wide diversity identified for low-mass protostellar envelope and
disk systems. We present detections and upper limits of thirteen small ($N_{\rm
atoms}\leq3$) C, N, O, and S carriers - namely CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, CN,
N$_2$H$^+$, C$_2$H, CS, SO, HCS$^+$, C$_2$S, SO$_2$, OCS - and some of their D,
$^{13}$C, $^{15}$N, $^{18}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{34}$S isotopologues. Together,
these species provide constraints on gas-phase C/N/O ratios, D- and
$^{15}$N-fractionation, source temperature and UV exposure, as well as the
overall S-chemistry. We find substantial evidence of chemical differentiation
among our source sample, some of which can be traced back to Class I physical
parameters, such as the disk-to-envelope mass ratio (proxy for Class I
evolutionary stage), the source luminosity, and the UV-field strength. Overall,
these first results allow us to start investigating the astrochemistry of Class
I objects, however, interferometric observations are needed to differentiate
envelope versus disk chemistry.</p>

          <p>Star-forming regions show a rich and varied chemistry, including the presence
of complex organic molecules - both in the cold gas distributed on large
scales, and in the hot regions close to young stars where protoplanetary disks
arise. Recent advances in observational techniques have opened new
possibilities for studying this chemistry. In particular, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has made it possible to study
astrochemistry down to Solar System size scales, while also revealing molecules
of increasing variety and complexity. In this review, we discuss recent
observations of the chemistry of star-forming environments, with a particular
focus on complex organic molecules, taking context from the laboratory
experiments and chemical models that they have stimulated. The key takeaway
points are: The physical evolution of individual sources plays a crucial role
in their inferred chemical signatures, and remains an important area for
observations and models to elucidate. Comparisons of the abundances measured
toward different star-forming environments (high-mass versus low-mass, Galactic
center versus Galactic disk) reveal a remarkable similarity, an indication that
the underlying chemistry is relatively independent of variations in their
physical conditions. Studies of molecular isotopologs in star-forming regions
provide a link with measurements in our own Solar System, and thus may shed
light on the chemical similarities and differences expected in other planetary
systems.</p>
