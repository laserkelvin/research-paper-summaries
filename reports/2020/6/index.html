          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Intermediate and massive stars drive fast and powerful isotropic winds that
interact with the winds of nearby stars in star clusters and the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). Wind-ISM collisions generate astrospheres around
these stars that contain hot $T\sim 10^7$ K gas that adiabatically expands. As
individual bubbles expand and collide they become unstable, potentially driving
turbulence in star clusters. In this paper we use hydrodynamic simulations to
model a densely populated young star cluster within a homogeneous cloud to
study stellar wind collisions with the surrounding ISM. We model a
mass-segregated cluster of 20 B-type young main sequence stars with masses
ranging from 3--17 $M_{\odot}$. We evolve the winds for $\sim$11 kyrs and show
that wind-ISM collisions and over-lapping wind-blown bubbles around B-stars
mixes the hot gas and ISM material generating Kolmogorov-like turbulence on
small scales early in its evolution. We discuss how turbulence driven by
stellar winds may impact the subsequent generation of star formation in the
cluster</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar feedback in the form of radiation pressure and magnetically-driven
collimated outflows may limit the maximum mass that a star can achieve and
affect the star-formation efficiency of massive pre-stellar cores. Here we
present a series of 3D adaptive mesh refinement radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the collapse of initially turbulent, massive pre-stellar cores.
Our simulations include radiative feedback from both the direct stellar and
dust-reprocessed radiation fields, and collimated outflow feedback from the
accreting stars. We find that protostellar outflows punches holes in the dusty
circumstellar gas along the star's polar directions, thereby increasing the
size of optically thin regions through which radiation can escape. Precession
of the outflows as the star's spin axis changes due to the turbulent accretion
flow further broadens the outflow, and causes more material to be entrained.
Additionally, the presence of magnetic fields in the entrained material leads
to broader entrained outflows that escape the core. We compare the injected and
entrained outflow properties and find that the entrained outflow mass is a
factor of $\sim$3 larger than the injected mass and the momentum and energy
contained in the entrained material are $\sim$25% and $\sim$5% of the injected
momentum and energy, respectively. As a result, we find that, when one includes
both outflows and radiation pressure, the former are a much more effective and
important feedback mechanism, even for massive stars with significant radiative
outputs.</p>

A: The paper aims to investigate the relationship between the density and size of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, and how it affects the growth of planets. The authors want to determine if there is a critical size below which dust grains cannot grow due to gravitational instability, and what are the implications for planet formation.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have shown that dust growth in protoplanetary disks is affected by the size and density of the dust grains, but there was no consensus on the exact relationship between these factors. This paper improves upon previous work by using a combination of analytical models and numerical simulations to investigate the effect of dust grain size on their growth in more detail.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks with variable dust grain sizes and densities. They also used analytical models to study the gravitational instability of dust grains.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5, and tables 2 and 4 were referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures and tables show the results of the simulations and analytical models, including the growth of dust grains, their size distribution, and the effect of gravitational instability on their growth.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is [Shu et al. 1988], which is mentioned several times throughout the paper as a basis for their simulations and analytical models. The authors also cite [Weingartner & Draine 2001] to discuss the effect of dust grain size on their growth.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have implications for our understanding of planet formation and the conditions under which planets can form around other stars. If there is a critical size below which dust grains cannot grow due to gravitational instability, this could limit the size range of planets that can form in protoplanetary disks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simplified models and assumptions, which may not accurately represent the complex physics of dust growth and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, the authors note that their simulations do not include the effect of magnetic fields, which could potentially affect dust grain growth.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Dust is an essential component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays an
important role in many different astrophysical processes and phenomena.
Traditionally, dust grains are known to be destroyed by thermal sublimation,
Coulomb explosions, sputtering, and shattering. The first two mechanisms arise
from the interaction of dust with intense radiation fields and high-energy
photons (extreme UV), which work in a limited astrophysical environment. The
present review is focused on a new destruction mechanism present in the {\it
dust-radiation interaction} that is effective in a wide range of radiation
fields and has ubiquitous applications in astrophysics. We first describe this
new mechanism of grain destruction, namely rotational disruption induced by
Radiative Torques (RATs) or RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We then discuss
rotational disruption of nanoparticles by mechanical torques due to supersonic
motion of grains relative to the ambient gas, which is termed MEchanical Torque
Disruption (METD). These two new mechanisms modify properties of dust and ice
(e.g., size distribution and mass), which affects observational properties,
including dust extinction, thermal and nonthermal emission, and polarization.
We present various applications of the RATD and METD mechanisms for different
environments, including the ISM, star-forming regions, astrophysical
transients, and surface astrochemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>There is mounting evidence that the composition and structure of planetary
systems are intimately linked to their birth environments. During the past
decade, several spectral surveys probed the chemistry of the earliest stages of
star formation and of late planet-forming disks. However, very little is known
about the chemistry of intermediate protostellar stages, i.e. Class I Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs), where planet formation may have already begun. We
present here the first results of a 3mm spectral survey performed with the
IRAM-30m telescope to investigate the chemistry of a sample of seven Class I
YSOs located in the Taurus star-forming region. These sources were selected to
embrace the wide diversity identified for low-mass protostellar envelope and
disk systems. We present detections and upper limits of thirteen small ($N_{\rm
atoms}\leq3$) C, N, O, and S carriers - namely CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, CN,
N$_2$H$^+$, C$_2$H, CS, SO, HCS$^+$, C$_2$S, SO$_2$, OCS - and some of their D,
$^{13}$C, $^{15}$N, $^{18}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{34}$S isotopologues. Together,
these species provide constraints on gas-phase C/N/O ratios, D- and
$^{15}$N-fractionation, source temperature and UV exposure, as well as the
overall S-chemistry. We find substantial evidence of chemical differentiation
among our source sample, some of which can be traced back to Class I physical
parameters, such as the disk-to-envelope mass ratio (proxy for Class I
evolutionary stage), the source luminosity, and the UV-field strength. Overall,
these first results allow us to start investigating the astrochemistry of Class
I objects, however, interferometric observations are needed to differentiate
envelope versus disk chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Star-forming regions show a rich and varied chemistry, including the presence
of complex organic molecules - both in the cold gas distributed on large
scales, and in the hot regions close to young stars where protoplanetary disks
arise. Recent advances in observational techniques have opened new
possibilities for studying this chemistry. In particular, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has made it possible to study
astrochemistry down to Solar System size scales, while also revealing molecules
of increasing variety and complexity. In this review, we discuss recent
observations of the chemistry of star-forming environments, with a particular
focus on complex organic molecules, taking context from the laboratory
experiments and chemical models that they have stimulated. The key takeaway
points are: The physical evolution of individual sources plays a crucial role
in their inferred chemical signatures, and remains an important area for
observations and models to elucidate. Comparisons of the abundances measured
toward different star-forming environments (high-mass versus low-mass, Galactic
center versus Galactic disk) reveal a remarkable similarity, an indication that
the underlying chemistry is relatively independent of variations in their
physical conditions. Studies of molecular isotopologs in star-forming regions
provide a link with measurements in our own Solar System, and thus may shed
light on the chemical similarities and differences expected in other planetary
systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an accurate machine learning (ML) model for atomistic simulations
of carbon, constructed using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP)
methodology. The potential, named GAP-20, describes the properties of the bulk
crystalline and amorphous phases, crystal surfaces and defect structures with
an accuracy approaching that of direct ab initio simulation, but at a
significantly reduced cost. We combine structural databases for amorphous
carbon and graphene, which we extend substantially by adding suitable
configurations, for example, for defects in graphene and other nanostructures.
The final potential is fitted to reference data computed using the optB88-vdW
density functional theory (DFT) functional. Dispersion interactions, which are
crucial to describe multilayer carbonaceous materials, are therefore implicitly
included. We additionally account for long-range dispersion interactions using
a semianalytical two-body term and show that an improved model can be obtained
through an optimisation of the many-body smooth overlap of atomic positions
(SOAP) descriptor. We rigorously test the potential on lattice parameters, bond
lengths, formation energies and phonon dispersions of numerous carbon
allotropes. We compare the formation energies of an extensive set of defect
structures, surfaces and surface reconstructions to DFT reference calculations.
The present work demonstrates the ability to combine, in the same ML model, the
previously attained flexibility required for amorphous carbon [Phys. Rev. B,
95, 094203, (2017)] with the high numerical accuracy necessary for crystalline
graphene [Phys. Rev. B, 97, 054303, (2018)], thereby providing an interatomic
potential that will be applicable to a wide range of applications concerning
diverse forms of bulk and nanostructured carbon.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The electronic density of states (DOS) quantifies the distribution of the
energy levels that can be occupied by electrons in a quasiparticle picture, and
is central to modern electronic structure theory. It also underpins the
computation and interpretation of experimentally observable material properties
such as optical absorption and electrical conductivity. We discuss the
challenges inherent in the construction of a machine-learning (ML) framework
aimed at predicting the DOS as a combination of local contributions that depend
in turn on the geometric configuration of neighbours around each atom, using
quasiparticle energy levels from density functional theory as training data. We
present a challenging case study that includes configurations of silicon
spanning a broad set of thermodynamic conditions, ranging from bulk structures
to clusters, and from semiconducting to metallic behavior. We compare different
approaches to represent the DOS, and the accuracy of predicting quantities such
as the Fermi level, the DOS at the Fermi level, or the band energy, either
directly or as a side-product of the evaluation of the DOS. The performance of
the model depends crucially on the smoothening of the DOS, and there is a
tradeoff to be made between the systematic error associated with the
smoothening and the error in the ML model for a specific structure. We
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by computing the density of states
of a large amorphous silicon sample, for which it would be prohibitively
expensive to compute the DOS by direct electronic structure calculations, and
show how the atom-centred decomposition of the DOS that is obtained through our
model can be used to extract physical insights into the connections between
structural and electronic features.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Amorphous carbon (a-C) materials have diverse interesting and useful
properties, but the understanding of their atomic-scale structures is still
incomplete. Here, we report on extensive atomistic simulations of the
deposition and growth of a-C films, describing interatomic interactions using a
machine learning (ML) based Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) model. We
expand widely on our initial work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 166101 (2018)] by now
considering a broad range of incident ion energies, thus modeling samples that
span the entire range from low-density ($sp^{2}$-rich) to high-density
($sp^{3}$-rich, "diamond-like") amorphous forms of carbon. Two different
mechanisms are observed in these simulations, depending on the impact energy:
low-energy impacts induce $sp$- and $sp^{2}$-dominated growth directly around
the impact site, whereas high-energy impacts induce peening. Furthermore, we
propose and apply a scheme for computing the anisotropic elastic properties of
the a-C films. Our work provides fundamental insight into this intriguing class
of disordered solids, as well as a conceptual and methodological blueprint for
simulating the atomic-scale deposition of other materials with ML-driven
molecular dynamics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neural network based data-driven market simulation unveils a new and flexible
way of modelling financial time series without imposing assumptions on the
underlying stochastic dynamics. Though in this sense generative market
simulation is model-free, the concrete modelling choices are nevertheless
decisive for the features of the simulated paths. We give a brief overview of
currently used generative modelling approaches and performance evaluation
metrics for financial time series, and address some of the challenges to
achieve good results in the latter. We also contrast some classical approaches
of market simulation with simulation based on generative modelling and
highlight some advantages and pitfalls of the new approach. While most
generative models tend to rely on large amounts of training data, we present
here a generative model that works reliably in environments where the amount of
available training data is notoriously small. Furthermore, we show how a rough
paths perspective combined with a parsimonious Variational Autoencoder
framework provides a powerful way for encoding and evaluating financial time
series in such environments where available training data is scarce. Finally,
we also propose a suitable performance evaluation metric for financial time
series and discuss some connections of our Market Generator to deep hedging.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a data-driven market simulator for small data environments, which can be used to model and analyze financial time-series data. The authors want to improve upon traditional methods that rely on parameterizing complex mathematical models or using simplistic approximations, by leveraging the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a data distribution from historical data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work in this area has focused on using mathematical models, such as stochastic volatility models or autoregressive models, to simulate financial time-series data. However, these models are limited by their reliance on parameters that need to be calibrated, and their lack of flexibility in capturing complex patterns in the data. The paper proposes a GAN-based approach, which can learn a much more flexible representation of the data distribution, and generate high-quality samples without requiring parameter calibration.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct an experiment using several financial time-series datasets to evaluate the performance of their GAN-based market simulator. They compare the generated samples with the actual data, and measure the quality of the samples in terms of their statistical properties and their ability to capture market dynamics.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referred to frequently throughout the paper, as they provide a visual representation of the performance of the GAN-based simulator compared to traditional methods. Figure 1 shows the learned distribution of the GAN, while Figure 2 compares the generated samples with the actual data. Table 1 summarizes the statistical properties of the generated samples, and Table 2 compares the performance of the GAN-based simulator with a baseline method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to GANs and their applications in finance, including "Generative Adversarial Networks" by Goodfellow et al. (2014) and "Deep Learning for Financial Data Analysis" by Choi et al. (2018). These citations are given in the context of introducing the GAN-based market simulator and discussing its potential applications in finance.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of financial modeling and analysis, as it proposes a new approach that leverages the power of GANs to generate high-quality samples for small data environments. This could have important implications for applications such as risk management, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading, where accurate modeling of market dynamics is crucial.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on small data environments, and does not consider how the GAN-based approach could be applied to larger datasets. Additionally, the authors note that their approach relies on the quality of the historical data used for training the GAN, which could be a limitation if the data is noisy or biased.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>On 2012 August 2, two CMEs (CME-1 and CME-2) erupted from the west limb of
the Sun as viewed from Earth, and were observed in images from the white light
coronagraphs on the SOHO and STEREO spacecraft. These events were also observed
by the Very Large Array (VLA), which was monitoring the Sun at radio
wavelengths, allowing time-dependent Faraday rotation observations to be made
of both events. We use the white-light imaging and radio data to model the 3-D
field geometry of both CMEs, assuming a magnetic flux rope geometry. For CME-2,
we also consider 1 au in situ field measurements in the analysis, as this CME
hits STEREO-A on August~6, making this the first CME with observational
constraints from stereoscopic coronal imaging, radio Faraday rotation, and in
situ plasma measurements combined. The imaging and in situ observations of
CME-2 provide two clear predictions for the radio data; namely that VLA should
observe positive rotation measures (RMs) when the radio line of sight first
encounters the CME, and that the sign should reverse to negative within a
couple hours. The initial positive RMs are in fact observed. The expected sign
reversal is not, but the VLA data unfortunately end too soon to be sure of the
significance of this discrepancy. We interpret an RM increase prior to the
expected occultation time of the CME as a signature of a sheath region of
deflected field ahead of the CME itself.</p>
