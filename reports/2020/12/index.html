          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects throughout
society, and science is no exception. The scale, speed, and breadth of the
scientific community's COVID-19 response has lead to the emergence of new
research literature on a remarkable scale -- as of October 2020, over 81,000
COVID-19 related scientific papers have been released, at a rate of over 250
per day. This has created a challenge to traditional methods of engagement with
the research literature; the volume of new research is far beyond the ability
of any human to read, and the urgency of response has lead to an increasingly
prominent role for pre-print servers and a diffusion of relevant research
across sources. These factors have created a need for new tools to change the
way scientific literature is disseminated. COVIDScholar is a knowledge portal
designed with the unique needs of the COVID-19 research community in mind,
utilizing NLP to aid researchers in synthesizing the information spread across
thousands of emergent research articles, patents, and clinical trials into
actionable insights and new knowledge. The search interface for this corpus,
https://covidscholar.org, now serves over 2000 unique users weekly. We present
also an analysis of trends in COVID-19 research over the course of 2020.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The IRDC SDC335.579-0.292 (SDC335) is a massive star-forming cloud found to
be globally collapsing towards one of the most massive star forming cores in
the Galaxy. SDC335 hosts three high-mass protostellar objects at early stages
of their evolution and archival ALMA Cycle 0 data indicate the presence of at
least one molecular outflow in the region. Observations of molecular outflows
from massive protostellar objects allow us to estimate the accretion rates of
the protostars as well as to assess the disruptive impact that stars have on
their natal clouds. The aim of this work is to identify and analyse the
properties of the protostellar-driven molecular outflows within SDC335 and use
these outflows to help refine the properties of the protostars. We imaged the
molecular outflows in SDC335 using new data from the ATCA of SiO and Class I
CH$_3$OH maser emission (~3 arcsec) alongside observations of four CO
transitions made with APEX and archival ALMA CO, $^{13}$CO (~1 arcsec), and HNC
data. We introduced a generalised argument to constrain outflow inclination
angles based on observed outflow properties. We used the properties of each
outflow to infer the accretion rates on the protostellar sources driving them
and to deduce the evolutionary characteristics of the sources. We identify
three molecular outflows in SDC335, one associated with each of the known
compact HII regions. The outflow properties show that the SDC335 protostars are
in the early stages (Class 0) of their evolution, with the potential to form
stars in excess of 50 M$_{\odot}$. The measured total accretion rate onto the
protostars is $1.4(\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to
the total mass infall rate toward the cloud centre on parsec scales of 2.5$(\pm
1.0) \times 10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting a near-continuous flow of
material from cloud to core scales. [abridged].</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately detecting and quantifying the molecular gas in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content. Existing methods are limited by their reliance on emission lines that are not always present or strong in these galaxies, making it difficult to determine their gas contents accurately.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in molecular gas detection and quantification relied on traditional emission line methods that are limited by the availability and strength of emission lines. This paper introduces a new method based on the use of CO and dust continuum observations, which provides a more reliable and accurate way to detect and quantify molecular gas in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of simulations using a modified version of the GRAFIC software package to test the performance of their new method. They compared the results of their method with those obtained using traditional emission line methods and found that it provided more accurate and reliable measurements of molecular gas in nearby galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the metallicity distribution of a sample of nearby galaxies, while Figure 2 demonstrates the limitations of traditional emission line methods. Table 1 presents the parameters used for the simulations, and Table 2 compares the results of the new method with those obtained using traditional emission line methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical background for the new method proposed in this paper. The reference [2] is also cited several times, as it presents a similar approach to molecular gas detection that was used for comparison purposes in this study.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the molecular gas content in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content. Accurate measurements of molecular gas are crucial for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as for understanding the role of gas in galaxy interactions and mergers.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on a simplifying assumption that the CO emission is proportional to the dust continuum emission, which may not always be true. They also note that their method can only provide an upper limit for the molecular gas content in galaxies with very low metallicity, as there may not be any detectable emission lines in these cases.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computing accurate reaction rates is a central challenge in computational
chemistry and biology because of the high cost of free energy estimation with
unbiased molecular dynamics. In this work, a data-driven machine learning
algorithm is devised to learn collective variables with a multitask neural
network, where a common upstream part reduces the high dimensionality of atomic
configurations to a low dimensional latent space, and separate downstream parts
map the latent space to predictions of basin class labels and potential
energies. The resulting latent space is shown to be an effective
low-dimensional representation, capturing the reaction progress and guiding
effective umbrella sampling to obtain accurate free energy landscapes. This
approach is successfully applied to model systems including a 5D M\"uller Brown
model, a 5D three-well model, and alanine dipeptide in vacuum. This approach
enables automated dimensionality reduction for energy controlled reactions in
complex systems, offers a unified framework that can be trained with limited
data, and outperforms single-task learning approaches, including autoencoders.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stars with masses between 1 and 8 solar masses (M$_\odot$) lose large amounts
of material in the form of gas and dust in the late stages of stellar
evolution, during their Asymptotic Giant Branch phase. Such stars supply up to
35% of the dust in the interstellar medium and thus contribute to the material
out of which our solar system formed. In addition, the circumstellar envelopes
of these stars are sites of complex, organic chemistry with over 80 molecules
detected in them. We show that internal ultraviolet photons, either emitted by
the star itself or from a close-in, orbiting companion, can significantly alter
the chemistry that occurs in the envelopes particularly if the envelope is
clumpy in nature. At least for the cases explored here, we find that the
presence of a stellar companion, such as a white dwarf star, the high flux of
UV photons destroys H$_2$O in the inner regions of carbon-rich AGB stars to
levels below those observed and produces species such as C$^+$ deep in the
envelope in contrast to the expectations of traditional descriptions of
circumstellar chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic framework (MOFs) are nanoporous materials that could be used to
capture carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas of fossil fuel power plants to
mitigate climate change. In this work, we design and train a message passing
neural network (MPNN) to predict simulated CO$_2$ adsorption in MOFs. Towards
providing insights into what substructures of the MOFs are important for the
prediction, we introduce a soft attention mechanism into the readout function
that quantifies the contributions of the node representations towards the graph
representations. We investigate different mechanisms for sparse attention to
ensure only the most relevant substructures are identified.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Hot Jupiters provide valuable natural laboratories for studying potential
contributions of high-energy radiation to prebiotic synthesis in the
atmospheres of exoplanets. In this fourth paper of the MOVES (Multiwavelength
Observations of an eVaporating Exoplanet and its Star) programme, we study the
effect of different types of high-energy radiation on the production of organic
and prebiotic molecules in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Our
model combines X-ray and UV observations from the MOVES programme and 3D
climate simulations from the 3D Met Office Unified Model to simulate the
atmospheric composition and kinetic chemistry with the STAND2019 network. Also,
the effects of galactic cosmic rays and stellar energetic particles are
included. We find that the differences in the radiation field between the
irradiated dayside and the shadowed nightside lead to stronger changes in the
chemical abundances than the variability of the host star's XUV emission. We
identify ammonium (NH4+) and oxonium (H3O+) as fingerprint ions for the
ionization of the atmosphere by both galactic cosmic rays and stellar
particles. All considered types of high-energy radiation have an enhancing
effect on the abundance of key organic molecules such as hydrogen cyanide
(HCN), formaldehyde (CH2O), and ethylene (C2H4). The latter two are
intermediates in the production pathway of the amino acid glycine (C2H5NO2) and
abundant enough to be potentially detectable by JWST.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Terrestrial extrasolar planets around low-mass stars are prime targets when
searching for atmospheric biosignatures with current and near-future
telescopes. The habitable-zone Super-Earth LHS 1140 b could hold a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and is an excellent candidate for detecting
atmospheric features. In this study, we investigate how the instellation and
planetary parameters influence the atmospheric climate, chemistry, and spectral
appearance of LHS 1140 b. We study the detectability of selected molecules, in
particular potential biosignatures, with the upcoming James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In a first step we use
the coupled climate-chemistry model, 1D-TERRA, to simulate a range of assumed
atmospheric chemical compositions dominated by H$_2$ and CO$_2$. Further, we
vary the concentrations of CH$_4$ by several orders of magnitude. In a second
step we calculate transmission spectra of the simulated atmospheres and compare
them to recent transit observations. Finally, we determine the observation time
required to detect spectral bands with low resolution spectroscopy using JWST
and the cross-correlation technique using ELT. In H$_2$-dominated and
CH$_4$-rich atmospheres O$_2$ has strong chemical sinks, leading to low
concentrations of O$_2$ and O$_3$. The potential biosignatures NH$_3$, PH$_3$,
CH$_3$Cl and N$_2$O are less sensitive to the concentration of H$_2$, CO$_2$
and CH$_4$ in the atmosphere. In the simulated H$_2$-dominated atmosphere the
detection of these gases might be feasible within 20 to 100 observation hours
with ELT or JWST, when assuming weak extinction by hazes. If further
observations of LHS 1140 b suggest a thin, clear, hydrogen-dominated
atmosphere, the planet would be one of the best known targets to detect
biosignature gases in the atmosphere of a habitable-zone rocky exoplanet with
upcoming telescopes.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the presence and distribution of water in the atmospheres of exoplanets using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. They specifically seek to determine whether water is abundant in the atmospheres of small, rocky planets similar to Earth.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for detecting water in exoplanet atmospheres involved using transmission spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes. This method had limited sensitivity and could only detect water in the atmospheres of larger planets. The current study improves upon this by using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to detect water in the atmospheres of smaller, rocky planets.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors analyzed spectra of 14 exoplanet hosts observed with the Hubble Space Telescope to search for signs of water in their atmospheres. They used a technique called "transit spectroscopy," which involves measuring the decrease in brightness of an exoplanet as it passes in front of its host star. By analyzing the light that passes through the planet's atmosphere, they could detect the presence of water and other molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 is referenced several times in the text as it shows the distribution of water in the atmospheres of exoplanets, including the sampled planets. Table 2 is also referenced often as it lists the parameters used to determine the presence of water in each planet's atmosphere.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Vinatier et al. (2010)" is cited several times in the text, as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the detection of water in exoplanet atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy. The reference "Yelle et al. (1993)" is also cited frequently, as it provides a historical context for the study of exoplanet atmospheres and the detection of water.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for the search for life beyond Earth, as water is a key ingredient for life as we know it. Determining whether water is abundant in the atmospheres of small, rocky planets can help us understand what conditions are necessary to support life on these planets.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their study only probes the upper atmosphere of the exoplanets and may not be representative of the entire atmospheric column. They also note that there is still uncertainty in the interpretation of the data due to the complexities of atmospheric modeling.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>
