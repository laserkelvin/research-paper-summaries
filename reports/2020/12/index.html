          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects throughout
society, and science is no exception. The scale, speed, and breadth of the
scientific community's COVID-19 response has lead to the emergence of new
research literature on a remarkable scale -- as of October 2020, over 81,000
COVID-19 related scientific papers have been released, at a rate of over 250
per day. This has created a challenge to traditional methods of engagement with
the research literature; the volume of new research is far beyond the ability
of any human to read, and the urgency of response has lead to an increasingly
prominent role for pre-print servers and a diffusion of relevant research
across sources. These factors have created a need for new tools to change the
way scientific literature is disseminated. COVIDScholar is a knowledge portal
designed with the unique needs of the COVID-19 research community in mind,
utilizing NLP to aid researchers in synthesizing the information spread across
thousands of emergent research articles, patents, and clinical trials into
actionable insights and new knowledge. The search interface for this corpus,
https://covidscholar.org, now serves over 2000 unique users weekly. We present
also an analysis of trends in COVID-19 research over the course of 2020.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The IRDC SDC335.579-0.292 (SDC335) is a massive star-forming cloud found to
be globally collapsing towards one of the most massive star forming cores in
the Galaxy. SDC335 hosts three high-mass protostellar objects at early stages
of their evolution and archival ALMA Cycle 0 data indicate the presence of at
least one molecular outflow in the region. Observations of molecular outflows
from massive protostellar objects allow us to estimate the accretion rates of
the protostars as well as to assess the disruptive impact that stars have on
their natal clouds. The aim of this work is to identify and analyse the
properties of the protostellar-driven molecular outflows within SDC335 and use
these outflows to help refine the properties of the protostars. We imaged the
molecular outflows in SDC335 using new data from the ATCA of SiO and Class I
CH$_3$OH maser emission (~3 arcsec) alongside observations of four CO
transitions made with APEX and archival ALMA CO, $^{13}$CO (~1 arcsec), and HNC
data. We introduced a generalised argument to constrain outflow inclination
angles based on observed outflow properties. We used the properties of each
outflow to infer the accretion rates on the protostellar sources driving them
and to deduce the evolutionary characteristics of the sources. We identify
three molecular outflows in SDC335, one associated with each of the known
compact HII regions. The outflow properties show that the SDC335 protostars are
in the early stages (Class 0) of their evolution, with the potential to form
stars in excess of 50 M$_{\odot}$. The measured total accretion rate onto the
protostars is $1.4(\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to
the total mass infall rate toward the cloud centre on parsec scales of 2.5$(\pm
1.0) \times 10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting a near-continuous flow of
material from cloud to core scales. [abridged].</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately detecting and quantifying the molecular gas in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content. Existing methods are limited by their reliance on emission lines that are not always present or strong in these galaxies, making it difficult to determine their gas contents accurately.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in molecular gas detection and quantification relied on traditional emission line methods that are limited by the availability and strength of emission lines. This paper introduces a new method based on the use of CO and dust continuum observations, which provides a more reliable and accurate way to detect and quantify molecular gas in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of simulations using a modified version of the GRAFIC software package to test the performance of their new method. They compared the results of their method with those obtained using traditional emission line methods and found that it provided more accurate and reliable measurements of molecular gas in nearby galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the metallicity distribution of a sample of nearby galaxies, while Figure 2 demonstrates the limitations of traditional emission line methods. Table 1 presents the parameters used for the simulations, and Table 2 compares the results of the new method with those obtained using traditional emission line methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical background for the new method proposed in this paper. The reference [2] is also cited several times, as it presents a similar approach to molecular gas detection that was used for comparison purposes in this study.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the molecular gas content in nearby galaxies, particularly those with low metal content. Accurate measurements of molecular gas are crucial for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as for understanding the role of gas in galaxy interactions and mergers.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on a simplifying assumption that the CO emission is proportional to the dust continuum emission, which may not always be true. They also note that their method can only provide an upper limit for the molecular gas content in galaxies with very low metallicity, as there may not be any detectable emission lines in these cases.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The Github repository link for this paper is not provided in the text.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computing accurate reaction rates is a central challenge in computational
chemistry and biology because of the high cost of free energy estimation with
unbiased molecular dynamics. In this work, a data-driven machine learning
algorithm is devised to learn collective variables with a multitask neural
network, where a common upstream part reduces the high dimensionality of atomic
configurations to a low dimensional latent space, and separate downstream parts
map the latent space to predictions of basin class labels and potential
energies. The resulting latent space is shown to be an effective
low-dimensional representation, capturing the reaction progress and guiding
effective umbrella sampling to obtain accurate free energy landscapes. This
approach is successfully applied to model systems including a 5D M\"uller Brown
model, a 5D three-well model, and alanine dipeptide in vacuum. This approach
enables automated dimensionality reduction for energy controlled reactions in
complex systems, offers a unified framework that can be trained with limited
data, and outperforms single-task learning approaches, including autoencoders.</p>
