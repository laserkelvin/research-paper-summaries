          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects throughout
society, and science is no exception. The scale, speed, and breadth of the
scientific community's COVID-19 response has lead to the emergence of new
research literature on a remarkable scale -- as of October 2020, over 81,000
COVID-19 related scientific papers have been released, at a rate of over 250
per day. This has created a challenge to traditional methods of engagement with
the research literature; the volume of new research is far beyond the ability
of any human to read, and the urgency of response has lead to an increasingly
prominent role for pre-print servers and a diffusion of relevant research
across sources. These factors have created a need for new tools to change the
way scientific literature is disseminated. COVIDScholar is a knowledge portal
designed with the unique needs of the COVID-19 research community in mind,
utilizing NLP to aid researchers in synthesizing the information spread across
thousands of emergent research articles, patents, and clinical trials into
actionable insights and new knowledge. The search interface for this corpus,
https://covidscholar.org, now serves over 2000 unique users weekly. We present
also an analysis of trends in COVID-19 research over the course of 2020.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of keyword extraction from text documents, particularly in the context of COVID-19 related articles, by proposing a novel approach based on unsupervised learning and meta vertex aggregation.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon existing work on keyword extraction, but notes that these methods are often limited by their reliance on handcrafted features or supervised learning approaches. The proposed approach, RaKUn, improves upon these methods by using unsupervised learning and meta vertex aggregation to extract keywords in a more efficient and effective manner.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper describes several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RaKUn approach. These include testing the method on various datasets, including a COVID-19 related dataset, and comparing the results to those obtained using existing keyword extraction methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The paper references several figures and tables throughout the text, but the most frequently cited are Figures 1 and 2, which illustrate the proposed RaKUn approach and its performance on various datasets. Table 1 is also cited frequently, as it provides an overview of the experimental setup used in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references, including earlier work on keyword extraction and unsupervised learning. These citations are provided to provide context for the proposed approach and to demonstrate its relevance to existing research in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the context of COVID-19 related articles. By proposing a novel approach to keyword extraction that can handle large volumes of text data efficiently and effectively, the paper could improve the accuracy and efficiency of text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors note that their proposed approach is limited to extracting keywords from text documents, and does not take into account other aspects of natural language processing, such as syntax or semantic analysis. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their method may not perform optimally on all types of text data, particularly those with complex structures or ambiguous language.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a GitHub code is provided in the paper.</p>
