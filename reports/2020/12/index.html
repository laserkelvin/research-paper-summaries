          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects throughout
society, and science is no exception. The scale, speed, and breadth of the
scientific community's COVID-19 response has lead to the emergence of new
research literature on a remarkable scale -- as of October 2020, over 81,000
COVID-19 related scientific papers have been released, at a rate of over 250
per day. This has created a challenge to traditional methods of engagement with
the research literature; the volume of new research is far beyond the ability
of any human to read, and the urgency of response has lead to an increasingly
prominent role for pre-print servers and a diffusion of relevant research
across sources. These factors have created a need for new tools to change the
way scientific literature is disseminated. COVIDScholar is a knowledge portal
designed with the unique needs of the COVID-19 research community in mind,
utilizing NLP to aid researchers in synthesizing the information spread across
thousands of emergent research articles, patents, and clinical trials into
actionable insights and new knowledge. The search interface for this corpus,
https://covidscholar.org, now serves over 2000 unique users weekly. We present
also an analysis of trends in COVID-19 research over the course of 2020.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of keyword extraction in text data, specifically focusing on the unsupervised learning and meta vertex aggregation approach proposed by the authors.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, traditional methods for keyword extraction rely on hand-crafted features and manual feature selection, which can be time-consuming and require domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages unsupervised learning and meta vertex aggregation to automatically extract relevant keywords from text data.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments using the collected dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. They tested different variations of their method and compared the results with the baseline approach of traditional keyword extraction methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figure 1, which illustrates the architecture of their proposed method, and Table 2, which shows the performance comparison of different approaches. These figures and tables are considered the most important for the paper as they provide a visual representation of the proposed approach and its performance compared to other methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited the reference [39] the most frequently, which is related to the YAKE! collection-independent automatic keyword extractor. They mentioned that this reference provides a different approach to keyword extraction that can be useful for comparison and validation of their proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of keyword extraction in text data, which can have practical applications in various fields such as information retrieval, text mining, and natural language processing.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed approach may not perform well on texts with complex structures or ambiguous keywords. They also mention that future work could focus on improving the robustness of the method to handle such cases.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to the Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
A: #keywordextraction #unsupervisedlearning #metavertexaggregation #textmining #naturallanguageprocessing #informationretrieval #keywordExtractor #unsupervised #machinelearning #computer science</p>
