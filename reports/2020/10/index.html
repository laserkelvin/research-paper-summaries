          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The biological molecules delivered to Earth on the board of meteorites and
comets were called one of the possible causes of the origin of life. Therefore,
our understanding of the routes of formation of biomolecules in space should
shed the light on the possibility of the existence of habitable extrasolar
planets. The large abundance of organic molecules is found in the space regions
with the lowest temperature. Different routes of the organics formation in
these areas were suggested. In this article, we demonstrate that complex
organic molecules same as important biological molecules can be formed due to
the reaction of C atoms with the mantels of molecular ices covering refractory
dust grains present in the interstellar medium (ISM). Having four valence
electrons, C atoms act as glue joining simple non-organic molecules and
converting them into organic matter. The formation of many molecules is
barrierless and thus can happen at low temperature. The barrierless reaction C
+ NH3 + CO -> NH2CHCO attracts particular interest. The product of this
reaction is an isomer of the central residue of a peptide chain and expected to
be efficiently formed in the translucent molecular clouds. The polymerization
of these molecules leads to the formation of proteins that according to some
theories are life's first molecules. Considering a high abundance of atomic
carbon in the ISM, we expect a high efficiency of the formation of a large
variety of different organic molecules, and show why the amount of organic
material formed by condensation of atomic carbon may be underestimated.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent knowledge of Galactic dynamics suggests that stars radially move on
the disk when they encounter transient spiral arms that are naturally generated
during the process of disk formation. We argue that a large movement of the
solar system from the innermost disk over its lifetime is inferred from a
comparison of the solar composition with those of solar twins within the
Galactic chemical evolution framework. The implied metal-rich environment at
the Sun's birthplace and formation time is supported by measured silicon
isotopic ratios in presolar silicon carbide grains. We perform numerical
simulations of the dynamical evolution of disk stars in a Milky Way-like galaxy
to identify the lifetime trajectory of the solar system. We find that a solar
system born in the proximity of the Galactic bulge could travel to the current
locus by the effect of radial migration induced by several major encounters
with spiral arms. The frequent feature we identify is the repeated passages of
stars inside the same spiral arm owing to the wobble of stars traveling in and
out of the spiral arms. We predict that such episodes are evidenced in the
Earth's geological history as snowball Earth and that their occurrence times
are within our prediction. In particular, the stellar motion that vertically
oscillates during passages through spiral arms occasionally leads to a split
into two discrete passage episodes with an interval of several tens of Myr,
implying two relevant snowball Earth events that occurred in rapid succession
(~7.2 and 6.5 hundred Myr ago).</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to study the impact of the local galactic environment on the formation and evolution of star clusters, specifically focusing on the role of gas stripping and tidal interactions.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have shown that gas stripping and tidal interactions play a crucial role in shaping the properties of star clusters, but there is still much to be learned about their exact impact. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by using high-resolution simulations to study these processes in more detail and to better understand their implications for star cluster formation and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used high-resolution simulations to model the formation and evolution of star clusters under different conditions, including varying levels of gas stripping and tidal interactions. They also compared their results to observations of real star clusters to validate their findings.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 were referenced most frequently in the text, as they provide key visualizations of the simulations results and help to illustrate the main findings of the paper. Table 2 is also important, as it summarizes the simulation parameters and provides a useful comparison with observed star cluster properties.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Saha et al. 2013] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of star cluster formation and evolution. The authors also cite [Ro´  skar et al. 2012] to support their claims about the impact of gas stripping on star cluster properties.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides new insights into the role of gas stripping and tidal interactions in shaping the properties of star clusters, which are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies as a whole. By improving our understanding of these processes, the authors' work has the potential to significantly impact the field of astrophysics and galaxy evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simulations, which have limitations in terms of their ability to perfectly model the real universe. Additionally, the authors' assumptions about the properties of gas stripping and tidal interactions may not be entirely accurate or complete.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a direct Github repository link for their paper, as they likely used a specific version control system (e.g., Git) to manage their code and data during the simulation process. However, they may have made some of their data or figures available on a GitHub repository if they are openly sharing their results.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
A: Here are ten possible hashtags that could be used to describe this paper: #starclusters, #galaxyformation, #tidalinteractions, #stripping, #simulations, #astrophysics, #cosmology, #highresolution, #galaxyevolution</p>

          <p>Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and
energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage,
and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the
catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational
catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models that
can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate
identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in
catalysis than related fields. To address this we developed the OC20 dataset,
consisting of 1,281,040 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations
(~264,890,000 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials,
surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We
supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale
molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises
three central tasks indicative of day-to-day catalyst modeling and comes with
pre-defined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with
future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph
neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet, Dimenet++) to each of these tasks as
baseline demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no
upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models
are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are
both provided as open resources, as well as a public leader board to encourage
community contributions to solve these important tasks.</p>

          <p>Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are
essential to addressing the world's rising energy needs while reducing climate
change. As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind
and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer
power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the
storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the
potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable
energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this
process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions.
An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions
at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density
functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated.
Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the
number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may
provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new
approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an
introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how
machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open
Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are
essential to addressing the world's rising energy needs while reducing climate
change. As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind
and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer
power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the
storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the
potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable
energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this
process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions.
An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions
at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density
functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated.
Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the
number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may
provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new
approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an
introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how
machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open
Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and
energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage,
and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the
catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational
catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models that
can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate
identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in
catalysis than related fields. To address this we developed the OC20 dataset,
consisting of 1,281,040 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations
(~264,890,000 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials,
surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We
supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale
molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises
three central tasks indicative of day-to-day catalyst modeling and comes with
pre-defined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with
future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph
neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet, Dimenet++) to each of these tasks as
baseline demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no
upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models
are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are
both provided as open resources, as well as a public leader board to encourage
community contributions to solve these important tasks.</p>
