          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the structure and properties of refractory oxides are critical
for high temperature applications. In this work, a combined experimental and
simulation approach uses an automated closed loop via an active-learner, which
is initialized by X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, and sequentially
improves a machine-learning model until the experimentally predetermined phase
space is covered. A multi-phase potential is generated for a canonical example
of the archetypal refractory oxide, HfO2, by drawing a minimum number of
training configurations from room temperature to the liquid state at ~2900oC.
The method significantly reduces model development time and human effort.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar feedback is needed to produce realistic giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
and galaxies in simulations, but due to limited numerical resolution, feedback
must be implemented using subgrid models. Observational work is an important
means to test and anchor these models, but limited studies have assessed the
relative dynamical role of multiple feedback modes, particularly at the
earliest stages of expansion when HII regions are still deeply embedded. In
this paper, we use multiwavelength (radio, infrared, and X-ray) data to measure
the pressures associated with direct radiation ($P_{\rm dir}$), dust-processed
radiation ($P_{\rm IR}$), photoionization heating ($P_{\rm HII}$), and
shock-heating from stellar winds ($P_{\rm X}$) in a sample of 106 young,
resolved HII regions with radii $\lesssim$0.5 pc to determine how stellar
feedback drives their expansion. We find that the $P_{\rm IR}$ dominates in 84%
of the regions and that the median $P_{\rm dir}$ and $P_{\rm HII}$ are smaller
than the median $P_{\rm IR}$ by factors of $\approx 6$ and $\approx 9$,
respectively. Based on the radial dependences of the pressure terms, we show
that HII regions transition from $P_{\rm IR}$-dominated to $P_{\rm
HII}$-dominated at radii of $\sim$3 pc. We find a median trapping factor of
$f_{\rm trap} \sim$ 8 without any radial dependence for the sample, suggesting
this value can be adopted in sub-grid feedback models. Moreover, we show that
the total pressure is greater than the gravitational pressure in the majority
of our sample, indicating that the feedback is sufficient to expel gas from the
regions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>As the inventory of interstellar molecules continues to grow, the gulf
between small species, whose individual rotational lines can be observed with
radio telescopes, and large ones, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) best studied in bulk via infrared and optical observations, is slowly

reservoirs is critical to understanding the interstellar carbon cycle, but will
require pushing the boundaries of how far we can probe molecular complexity
while still retaining observational specificity. Toward this end, we present a
method for detecting and characterizing new molecular species in single-dish
observations toward sources with sparse line spectra. We have applied this
method to data from the ongoing GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting
Aromatic Molecules) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) large program, discovering six
new interstellar species. In this paper we highlight the detection of
HC$_{11}$N, the largest cyanopolyyne in the interstellar medium.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Benzonitrile ($c$-C$_6$H$_5$CN), a polar proxy for benzene ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$}),
has the potential to serve as a highly convenient radio probe for aromatic
chemistry, provided this ring can be found in other astronomical sources beyond
the molecule-rich prestellar cloud TMC-1 where it was first reported by McGuire
et al. in 2018. Here we present radio astronomical evidence of benzonitrile in
four additional pre-stellar, and possibly protostellar, sources: Serpens 1A,
Serpens 1B, Serpens 2, and MC27/L1521F. These detections establish benzonitrile
is not unique to TMC-1; rather aromatic chemistry appears to be widespread
throughout the earliest stages of star formation, likely persisting at least to
the initial formation of a protostar. The abundance of benzonitrile far exceeds
predictions from models which well reproduce the abundances of carbon chains,
such as HC$_7$N, a cyanpolyyne with the same heavy atoms, indicating the
chemistry responsible for planar carbon structures (as opposed to linear ones)
in primordial sources is favorable but not well understood. The abundance of
benzonitrile relative to carbon-chain molecules displays sizable variations
between sources within the Taurus and Serpens clouds, implying the importance
of physical conditions and initial elemental reservoirs of the clouds
themselves.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar space through chemical reactions on dust grains, and to develop a comprehensive chemical model that can explain the observed abundances of these molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in interstellar chemistry models was based on simplified gas-grain chemistry, which did not include the necessary details of dust grain surfaces and chemical reactions. This paper improved upon that by including detailed surface chemistry and chemical reactions on dust grains, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of complex organic molecule formation in interstellar space.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of chemical simulations using the NAUTILUS code, which included different gas and grain temperatures, densities, and initial oxygen abundances. They also explored various combinations of gas and dust composition to investigate their impact on molecular formation.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, 5, and Tables 1-3 were referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the abundance patterns of various molecules and their dependence on different model parameters.</p>

A: This paper has significant implications for understanding the formation and distribution of complex organic molecules in interstellar space. The developed chemical model can be used to interpret observations from space missions such as the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, which will provide new insights into the interstellar medium.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the chemical simulations were conducted using a simplified gas-grain chemistry model, which may not capture all the complexities of real dust grains and their surfaces. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their results are sensitive to the choice of input parameters, such as the initial oxygen abundance.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>As the inventory of interstellar molecules continues to grow, the gulf
between small species, whose individual rotational lines can be observed with
radio telescopes, and large ones, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) best studied in bulk via infrared and optical observations, is slowly
being bridged. Understanding the connection between these two molecular
reservoirs is critical to understanding the interstellar carbon cycle, but will
require pushing the boundaries of how far we can probe molecular complexity
while still retaining observational specificity. Toward this end, we present a
method for detecting and characterizing new molecular species in single-dish
observations toward sources with sparse line spectra. We have applied this
method to data from the ongoing GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting
Aromatic Molecules) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) large program, discovering six
new interstellar species. In this paper we highlight the detection of
HC$_{11}$N, the largest cyanopolyyne in the interstellar medium.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Determining the vibrational structure of a molecule is central to fundamental
applications in several areas, from atmospheric science to catalysis, fuel
combustion modeling, biochemical imaging, and astrochemistry. However, when
significant anharmonicity and mode coupling are present, the problem is
classically intractable for a molecule of just a few atoms. Here, we outline a
set of quantum algorithms for solving the molecular vibrational structure
problem for both near- and long-term quantum computers. There are previously
unaddressed characteristics of this problem which require approaches distinct
from most instances of the commonly studied quantum simulation of electronic
structure: many eigenstates are often desired, states of interest are often far
from the ground state (requiring methods for "zooming in" to some energy
window), and transition amplitudes with respect to a non-unitary Hermitian
operator must be calculated. We address these hurdles and consider problem
instances of four molecular vibrational Hamiltonians. Finally and most
importantly, we give analytical and numerical results which suggest that, to a
given energy precision, a vibrational problem instance will be simulatable on a
quantum computer before an electronic structure problem instance. These results
imply that more focus in the quantum information community ought to shift
toward scientifically and industrially important quantum vibrational problems.</p>

          <p>Artificial neural networks are used to fit a potential energy surface. We
demonstrate the benefits of using not only energies, but also their first and
second derivatives as training data for the neural network. This ensures smooth
and accurate Hessian surfaces, which are required for rate constant
calculations using instanton theory. Our aim was a local, accurate fit rather
than a global PES, because instanton theory requires information on the
potential only in the close vicinity of the main tunneling path. Elongations
along vibrational normal modes at the transition state are used as coordinates
for the neural network. The method is applied to the hydrogen abstraction
reaction from methanol, calculated on a coupled-cluster level of theory. The
reaction is essential in astrochemistry to explain the deuteration of methanol
in the interstellar medium.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the degree of chemical complexity that can be reached in
star-forming regions, together with the identification of precursors of the
building blocks of life in the interstellar medium, is one of the goals of
astrochemistry. Unbiased spectral surveys with large bandwidth and high
spectral resolution are thus needed, to resolve line blending in chemically
rich sources and identify complex organic molecules. This kind of observations
has been successfully carried out, mainly towards the Galactic Center, a region
that shows peculiar environmental conditions. We present an unbiased spectral
survey at 3mm of one of the most chemically rich hot molecular cores located
outside the Galactic Center, in the high-mass star-forming region G31.41+0.31.
In this first paper, we present the survey and discuss the detection of the 3
isomers of C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O$_{2}$: methyl formate, glycolaldehyde and acetic
acid. Observations were carried out with ALMA and cover the entire Band 3 from
84 to 116 GHz with an angular resolution of $1.2^{''}$x$1.2^{''}$ and a
spectral resolution of $\sim0.488$ MHz. The transitions of the 3 molecules have
been analyzed with the software XCLASS. All three isomers were detected and
methyl formate and acetic acid abundances in G31 are the highest detected up to
now, if compared to sources in literature. The size of the emission varies
among the three isomers with acetic acid showing the most compact emission
while methyl formate the most extended. The comparison with chemical models
suggests the necessity of grain-surface routes for the formation of methyl
formate in G31, while for glycolaldehyde both scenarios could be feasible.
Proposed grain-surface reaction for acetic acid is not able to reproduce the
observed abundance in this work, while gas-phase scenario should be further
tested due to large uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors are trying to identify and quantify the contributions of different isotopologues of CH2OHCHO (formaldehyde) to its absorption spectrum. They aim to improve upon previous studies by providing a more accurate determination of the isotopic abundances and their impact on the observed line intensities.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in isotopic analysis of CH2OHCHO involved using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to estimate the isotopic abundances.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The technical and economic feasibility to deliver sustainable liquid biocrude
through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) while enabling negative carbon dioxide
emissions is evaluated in this paper, looking into the potential of the process
in the context of negative emission technologies (NETs) for climate change
mitigation. In the HTL process, a gas phase consisting mainly of carbon dioxide
is obtained as a side product driving a potential for the implementation of
carbon capture and storage in the process (BECCS) that has not been explored
yet in the existing literature and is undertaken in this study. To this end,
the process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on,
having forestry residues as feedstock. The Selexol technology is adapted in a
novel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover
the excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that
the additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from
the excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in
the MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most
favorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113%
compared to the fossil baseline. These results show that the implementation of
CCS in the HTL process is a promising alternative from technical, economic and
environmental perspective in future scenarios in which advanced liquid biofuels
and NETs are expected to play a role in the decarbonization of the energy
system.</p>
