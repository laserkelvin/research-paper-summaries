          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the structure and properties of refractory oxides are critical
for high temperature applications. In this work, a combined experimental and
simulation approach uses an automated closed loop via an active-learner, which
is initialized by X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, and sequentially
improves a machine-learning model until the experimentally predetermined phase
space is covered. A multi-phase potential is generated for a canonical example
of the archetypal refractory oxide, HfO2, by drawing a minimum number of
training configurations from room temperature to the liquid state at ~2900oC.
The method significantly reduces model development time and human effort.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar feedback is needed to produce realistic giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
and galaxies in simulations, but due to limited numerical resolution, feedback
must be implemented using subgrid models. Observational work is an important
means to test and anchor these models, but limited studies have assessed the
relative dynamical role of multiple feedback modes, particularly at the
earliest stages of expansion when HII regions are still deeply embedded. In
this paper, we use multiwavelength (radio, infrared, and X-ray) data to measure
the pressures associated with direct radiation ($P_{\rm dir}$), dust-processed
radiation ($P_{\rm IR}$), photoionization heating ($P_{\rm HII}$), and
shock-heating from stellar winds ($P_{\rm X}$) in a sample of 106 young,
resolved HII regions with radii $\lesssim$0.5 pc to determine how stellar
feedback drives their expansion. We find that the $P_{\rm IR}$ dominates in 84%
of the regions and that the median $P_{\rm dir}$ and $P_{\rm HII}$ are smaller
than the median $P_{\rm IR}$ by factors of $\approx 6$ and $\approx 9$,
respectively. Based on the radial dependences of the pressure terms, we show
that HII regions transition from $P_{\rm IR}$-dominated to $P_{\rm
HII}$-dominated at radii of $\sim$3 pc. We find a median trapping factor of
$f_{\rm trap} \sim$ 8 without any radial dependence for the sample, suggesting
this value can be adopted in sub-grid feedback models. Moreover, we show that
the total pressure is greater than the gravitational pressure in the majority
of our sample, indicating that the feedback is sufficient to expel gas from the
regions.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of limited availability and quality of labeled data for training deep learning models, particularly in the field of medical image segmentation.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works have focused on using unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data for training deep learning models. However, these methods often fail to produce accurate results due to the lack of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes weakly supervised learning to improve the quality and quantity of labeled data available for training, thereby improving the performance of deep learning models.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their weakly supervised learning approach. These include (1) using a large-scale dataset of medical images with weak labels to train a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance on a set of tasks; (2) comparing the performance of the weakly supervised model with that of a strong supervision baseline model; and (3) analyzing the impact of different components of the proposed approach on the final model performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 4, and Table 1 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the pipeline of the proposed approach, while Figure 2 shows the performance comparison between the weakly supervised model and a strong supervision baseline model. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset used in the experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Utomo et al. (2018)" is cited the most frequently in the paper, primarily in the context of discussing related work on weakly supervised learning for medical image segmentation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of medical image segmentation by providing a novel approach to leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data for training deep learning models. This could help address the limited availability and quality of labeled data, which is a major challenge in this field.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on the quality of the weak labels provided, which may not always be accurate or consistent. They also note that their approach may not perform as well as a strong supervision baseline model in certain tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Benzonitrile ($c$-C$_6$H$_5$CN), a polar proxy for benzene ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$}),
has the potential to serve as a highly convenient radio probe for aromatic
chemistry, provided this ring can be found in other astronomical sources beyond
the molecule-rich prestellar cloud TMC-1 where it was first reported by McGuire
et al. in 2018. Here we present radio astronomical evidence of benzonitrile in
four additional pre-stellar, and possibly protostellar, sources: Serpens 1A,
Serpens 1B, Serpens 2, and MC27/L1521F. These detections establish benzonitrile
is not unique to TMC-1; rather aromatic chemistry appears to be widespread
throughout the earliest stages of star formation, likely persisting at least to
the initial formation of a protostar. The abundance of benzonitrile far exceeds
predictions from models which well reproduce the abundances of carbon chains,
such as HC$_7$N, a cyanpolyyne with the same heavy atoms, indicating the
chemistry responsible for planar carbon structures (as opposed to linear ones)
in primordial sources is favorable but not well understood. The abundance of
benzonitrile relative to carbon-chain molecules displays sizable variations
between sources within the Taurus and Serpens clouds, implying the importance
of physical conditions and initial elemental reservoirs of the clouds
themselves.</p>
