          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Progress towards the energy breakthroughs needed to combat climate change can
be significantly accelerated through the efficient simulation of atomic
systems. Simulation techniques based on first principles, such as Density
Functional Theory (DFT), are limited in their practical use due to their high
computational expense. Machine learning approaches have the potential to
approximate DFT in a computationally efficient manner, which could dramatically
increase the impact of computational simulations on real-world problems.
Approximating DFT poses several challenges. These include accurately modeling
the subtle changes in the relative positions and angles between atoms, and
enforcing constraints such as rotation invariance or energy conservation. We
introduce a novel approach to modeling angular information between sets of
neighboring atoms in a graph neural network. Rotation invariance is achieved
for the network's edge messages through the use of a per-edge local coordinate
frame and a novel spin convolution over the remaining degree of freedom. Two
model variants are proposed for the applications of structure relaxation and
molecular dynamics. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on the
large-scale Open Catalyst 2020 dataset. Comparisons are also performed on the
MD17 and QM9 datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning has enabled the prediction of quantum chemical properties
with high accuracy and efficiency, allowing to bypass computationally costly ab
initio calculations. Instead of training on a fixed set of properties, more
recent approaches attempt to learn the electronic wavefunction (or density) as
a central quantity of atomistic systems, from which all other observables can
be derived. This is complicated by the fact that wavefunctions transform
non-trivially under molecular rotations, which makes them a challenging
prediction target. To solve this issue, we introduce general SE(3)-equivariant
operations and building blocks for constructing deep learning architectures for
geometric point cloud data and apply them to reconstruct wavefunctions of
atomistic systems with unprecedented accuracy. Our model achieves speedups of
over three orders of magnitude compared to ab initio methods and reduces
prediction errors by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous
state-of-the-art. This accuracy makes it possible to derive properties such as
energies and forces directly from the wavefunction in an end-to-end manner. We
demonstrate the potential of our approach in a transfer learning application,
where a model trained on low accuracy reference wavefunctions implicitly learns
to correct for electronic many-body interactions from observables computed at a
higher level of theory. Such machine-learned wavefunction surrogates pave the
way towards novel semi-empirical methods, offering resolution at an electronic
level while drastically decreasing computational cost. Additionally, the
predicted wavefunctions can serve as initial guess in conventional ab initio
methods, decreasing the number of iterations required to arrive at a converged
solution, thus leading to significant speedups without any loss of accuracy or
robustness.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A new graph-based order parameter is introduced for the characterization of
atomistic structures. The order parameter is universal to any material/chemical
system, and is transferable to all structural geometries. Three sets of data
are used to validate both the generalizability and accuracy of the algorithm:
(1) liquid lithium configurations spanning up to 300 GPa, (2) condensed phases
of carbon along with nanotubes and buckyballs at ambient and high temperature,
and (3) a diverse set of aluminum configurations including surfaces, compressed
and expanded lattices, point defects, grain boundaries, liquids, nanoparticles,
all at non-zero temperatures. The aluminum configurations are also compared to
existing characterization methods for both speed and accuracy. Our order
parameter uniquely classifies every configuration and outperforms all
crystalline order parameters studied here, opening the door for its use in a
multitude of complex application spaces that can require fine configurational
characterization of materials.</p>
