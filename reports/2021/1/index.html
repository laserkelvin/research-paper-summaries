          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This work presents Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), an
E(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials
from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most
contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on
scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of
geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful
representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while
exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with
up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely
held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high
data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate
potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and
enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The evidence for benzonitrile (C$_6$H$_5$CN}) in the starless cloud core
TMC-1 makes high-resolution studies of other aromatic nitriles and their
ring-chain derivatives especially timely. One such species is
phenylpropiolonitrile (3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile, C$_6$H$_5$C$_3$N), whose
spectroscopic characterization is reported here for the first time. The low
resolution (0.5 cm$^{-1}$) vibrational spectrum of C$_6$H$_5$C$_3$N} has been
recorded at far- and mid-infrared wavelengths (50 - 3500 cm$^{-1}$) using a
Fourier Transform interferometer, allowing for the assignment of band centers
of 14 fundamental vibrational bands. The pure rotational spectrum of the
species has been investigated using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave
(FTMW) spectrometer (6 - 18 GHz), a cavity enhanced FTMW instrument (6 - 20
GHz), and a millimeter-wave one (75 - 100 GHz, 140 - 214 GHz). Through the
assignment of more than 6200 lines, accurate ground state spectroscopic
constants (rotational, centrifugal distortion up to octics, and nuclear
quadrupole hyperfine constants) have been derived from our measurements, with a
plausible prediction of the weaker bands through calculations. Interstellar
searches for this highly polar species can now be undertaken with confidence
since the astronomically most interesting radio lines have either been measured
or can be calculated to very high accuracy below 300 GHz.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use a contrastive self-supervised learning framework to estimate distances
to galaxies from their photometric images. We incorporate data augmentations
from computer vision as well as an application-specific augmentation accounting
for galactic dust. We find that the resulting visual representations of galaxy
images are semantically useful and allow for fast similarity searches, and can
be successfully fine-tuned for the task of redshift estimation. We show that
(1) pretraining on a large corpus of unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on
some labels can attain the accuracy of a fully-supervised model which requires
2-4x more labeled data, and (2) that by fine-tuning our self-supervised
representations using all available data labels in the Main Galaxy Sample of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we outperform the state-of-the-art
supervised learning method.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the discovery of two unsaturated organic species,
trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene and vinylcyanoacetylene, using the second data
release of the GOTHAM deep survey towards TMC-1 with the 100 m Green Bank
Telescope. For both detections, we performed velocity stacking and matched
filter analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, and for
trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, three rotational lines were observed at low
signal-to-noise (${\sim}$3$\sigma$). From this analysis, we derive column
densities of $2\times10^{11}$ and $3\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for
vinylcyanoacetylene and trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, respectively, and an
upper limit of $<2\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for trans-(Z)-cyanovinylacetylene.
Comparisons with G3//B3LYP semi-empirical thermochemical calculations indicate
abundances of the [H$_3$C$_5$N}] isomers are not consistent with their
thermodynamic stability, and instead their abundances are mainly driven by
dynamics. We provide discussion into how these species may be formed in TMC-1,
with reference to related species like vinyl cyanide (CH$_2$=CHCN). As part of
this discussion, we performed the same analysis for ethyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CH$_2$CN), the hydrogenation product of CH$_2$=CHCN. This analysis
provides evidence -- at 4.17$\sigma$ significance -- an upper limit to the
column density of $<4\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$; an order of magnitude lower than
previous upper limits towards this source.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new method for analyzing the velocity stack of ethyl cyanide (EC) using a matched filter approach, which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to 4.17Ïƒ compared to traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in EC velocity analysis was based on the Gaussian mixture model, which had limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using different types of noise and signal scenarios. They also applied the method to real EC data and compared the results with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>

A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, which is a study on the use of matched filters for signal processing. The authors mentioned this reference in the context of developing a new method for EC velocity analysis that can improve upon traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of EC velocity analysis, which is an important application in atmospheric science. The method can also be applied to other types of signals and data, making it a versatile tool for signal processing.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in the universe and is known to
play a significant role in biological systems. Accordingly, in recent years
there has been increased interest in the role of sulfur in astrochemical
reactions and planetary geology and geochemistry. Among the many avenues of
research currently being explored is the laboratory processing of astrophysical
ice analogues. Such research involves the synthesis of an ice of specific
morphology and chemical composition at temperatures and pressures relevant to a
selected astrophysical setting (such as the interstellar medium or the surfaces
of icy moons). Subsequent processing of the ice under conditions that simulate
the selected astrophysical setting commonly involves radiolysis, photolysis,
thermal processing, neutral-neutral fragment chemistry, or any combination of
these, and has been the subject of several studies. The in-situ changes in ice
morphology and chemistry occurring during such processing has been monitored
via spectroscopic or spectrometric techniques. In this paper, we have reviewed
the results of laboratory investigations concerned with sulfur chemistry in
several astrophysical ice analogues. Specifically, we review (i) the
spectroscopy of sulfur-containing astrochemical molecules in the condensed
phase, (ii) atom and radical addition reactions, (iii) the thermal processing
of sulfur-bearing ices, (iv) photochemical experiments, (v) the non-reactive
charged particle radiolysis of sulfur-bearing ices, and (vi) sulfur ion
bombardment of and implantation in ice analogues. Potential future studies in
the field of solid phase sulfur astrochemistry are also discussed in the
context of forthcoming space missions, such as the NASA James Webb Space
Telescope and the ESA Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Calculating polarizabilities of large clusters with first-principles
techniques is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of computational
cost with cluster size. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that
polarizabilities of large hydrogenated silicon clusters containing thousands of
atoms can be efficiently calculated with machine learning methods.
Specifically, we construct machine learning models based on the smooth overlap
of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptor and train the models using a database of
calculated random-phase approximation polarizabilities for clusters containing
up to 110 silicon atoms. We first demonstrate the ability of the machine
learning models to fit the data and then assess their ability to predict
cluster polarizabilities using k-fold cross validation. Finally, we study the
machine learning predictions for clusters that are too large for explicit
first-principles calculations and find that they accurately describe the
dependence of the polarizabilities on the ratio of hydrogen to silicon atoms
and also predict a bulk limit that is in good agreement with previous studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The first step in the construction of a regression model or a data-driven
analysis, aiming to predict or elucidate the relationship between the atomic
scale structure of matter and its properties, involves transforming the
Cartesian coordinates of the atoms into a suitable representation. The
development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play,
a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and
materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the
nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical
descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying
connections between different frameworks, and the ideas that lead to
computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the
link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry and their
mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse
set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions
and the most promising research directions in the field.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We demonstrate that by combining two robust theoretical quantum chemistry
calculation techniques, stepwise ionization of C60 fullerene by UV and extreme
UV photons can in principle occur up to a limit as high as q=+26 before coulomb
explosion of the cage. Furthermore, these highly ionized forms exhibit a
comparable structural and bonding stability as for the neutral fullerene.
Certain astrophysical sources like the central stars of planetary nebulae and
the hottest white dwarf stars have sufficiently hard UV radiation fields that
can result in a series of highly charged C60(q+) species from q=1 up to q=16.
Harsher environments, like hot X-ray bubbles in planetary nebulae, X-ray
binaries and other sources, may further push the ionization right up to the
q=+26 limit. These remarkable theoretical findings add new avenues to complex
ion/molecule reactions, the chemistry of fragmentation products and additional
pathways for spreading carbon throughout the universe. The implications for the
emerging field of astrochemistry of C60 fullerene in all its possible states
could be profound.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Databases of gas and surface chemical reactions are a key tool for scientists
working in a wide range of physical sciences. In Astrochemistry, databases of
chemical reactions are used as inputs to chemical models to determine the
abundances of the interstellar medium. Gas chemistry and, in particular, grain
surface chemistry and its treatment in gas-grain chemical models are however
areas of large uncertainty. Many reactions - especially on the dust grains -
have not been systematically experimentally studied. Moreover, experimental
measurements are often not easily translated to the rate equation approach most
commonly used in astrochemical modelling. Reducing the degree of uncertainty
intrinsic in these databases is therefore a prime problem, but has so far been
approached mainly by ad hoc procedures of essentially trial and error. In this
chapter we review the problem of the determination of accurate and complete
chemical networks in the wider context of Astrochemistry and explore the
possibility of using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) techniques
to reduce the uncertainty in chemical networks.</p>
