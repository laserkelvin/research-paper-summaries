          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This work presents Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), an
E(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials
from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most
contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on
scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of
geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful
representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while
exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with
up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely
held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high
data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate
potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and
enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The evidence for benzonitrile (C$_6$H$_5$CN}) in the starless cloud core
TMC-1 makes high-resolution studies of other aromatic nitriles and their
ring-chain derivatives especially timely. One such species is
phenylpropiolonitrile (3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile, C$_6$H$_5$C$_3$N), whose
spectroscopic characterization is reported here for the first time. The low
resolution (0.5 cm$^{-1}$) vibrational spectrum of C$_6$H$_5$C$_3$N} has been
recorded at far- and mid-infrared wavelengths (50 - 3500 cm$^{-1}$) using a
Fourier Transform interferometer, allowing for the assignment of band centers
of 14 fundamental vibrational bands. The pure rotational spectrum of the
species has been investigated using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave
(FTMW) spectrometer (6 - 18 GHz), a cavity enhanced FTMW instrument (6 - 20
GHz), and a millimeter-wave one (75 - 100 GHz, 140 - 214 GHz). Through the
assignment of more than 6200 lines, accurate ground state spectroscopic
constants (rotational, centrifugal distortion up to octics, and nuclear
quadrupole hyperfine constants) have been derived from our measurements, with a
plausible prediction of the weaker bands through calculations. Interstellar
searches for this highly polar species can now be undertaken with confidence
since the astronomically most interesting radio lines have either been measured
or can be calculated to very high accuracy below 300 GHz.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use a contrastive self-supervised learning framework to estimate distances
to galaxies from their photometric images. We incorporate data augmentations
from computer vision as well as an application-specific augmentation accounting
for galactic dust. We find that the resulting visual representations of galaxy
images are semantically useful and allow for fast similarity searches, and can
be successfully fine-tuned for the task of redshift estimation. We show that
(1) pretraining on a large corpus of unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on
some labels can attain the accuracy of a fully-supervised model which requires
2-4x more labeled data, and (2) that by fine-tuning our self-supervised
representations using all available data labels in the Main Galaxy Sample of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we outperform the state-of-the-art
supervised learning method.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the discovery of two unsaturated organic species,
trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene and vinylcyanoacetylene, using the second data
release of the GOTHAM deep survey towards TMC-1 with the 100 m Green Bank
Telescope. For both detections, we performed velocity stacking and matched
filter analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, and for
trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, three rotational lines were observed at low
signal-to-noise (${\sim}$3$\sigma$). From this analysis, we derive column
densities of $2\times10^{11}$ and $3\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for
vinylcyanoacetylene and trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, respectively, and an
upper limit of $<2\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for trans-(Z)-cyanovinylacetylene.
Comparisons with G3//B3LYP semi-empirical thermochemical calculations indicate
abundances of the [H$_3$C$_5$N}] isomers are not consistent with their
thermodynamic stability, and instead their abundances are mainly driven by
dynamics. We provide discussion into how these species may be formed in TMC-1,
with reference to related species like vinyl cyanide (CH$_2$=CHCN). As part of
this discussion, we performed the same analysis for ethyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CH$_2$CN), the hydrogenation product of CH$_2$=CHCN. This analysis
provides evidence -- at 4.17$\sigma$ significance -- an upper limit to the
column density of $<4\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$; an order of magnitude lower than
previous upper limits towards this source.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in the universe and is known to
play a significant role in biological systems. Accordingly, in recent years
there has been increased interest in the role of sulfur in astrochemical
reactions and planetary geology and geochemistry. Among the many avenues of
research currently being explored is the laboratory processing of astrophysical
ice analogues. Such research involves the synthesis of an ice of specific
morphology and chemical composition at temperatures and pressures relevant to a
selected astrophysical setting (such as the interstellar medium or the surfaces
of icy moons). Subsequent processing of the ice under conditions that simulate
the selected astrophysical setting commonly involves radiolysis, photolysis,
thermal processing, neutral-neutral fragment chemistry, or any combination of
these, and has been the subject of several studies. The in-situ changes in ice
morphology and chemistry occurring during such processing has been monitored
via spectroscopic or spectrometric techniques. In this paper, we have reviewed
the results of laboratory investigations concerned with sulfur chemistry in
several astrophysical ice analogues. Specifically, we review (i) the
spectroscopy of sulfur-containing astrochemical molecules in the condensed
phase, (ii) atom and radical addition reactions, (iii) the thermal processing
of sulfur-bearing ices, (iv) photochemical experiments, (v) the non-reactive
charged particle radiolysis of sulfur-bearing ices, and (vi) sulfur ion
bombardment of and implantation in ice analogues. Potential future studies in
the field of solid phase sulfur astrochemistry are also discussed in the
context of forthcoming space missions, such as the NASA James Webb Space
Telescope and the ESA Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission.</p>
