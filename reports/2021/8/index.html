          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for challenging
catalytic transformations due to their well-defined structures and high degree
of synthetic tunability. These features, at least in principle, make MOFs
ideally suited for a computational approach towards catalyst design and
discovery. Nonetheless, the widespread use of data science and machine learning
to accelerate the discovery of MOF catalysts has yet to be substantially
realized. In this review, we provide an overview of recent work that sets the
stage for future high-throughput computational screening and machine learning
studies involving MOF catalysts. This is followed by a discussion of several
challenges currently facing the broad adoption of data-centric approaches in
MOF computational catalysis, and we share possible solutions that can help
propel the field forward.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Peptide bonds, as the molecular bridges that connect amino acids, are crucial
to the formation of proteins. Searches and studies of molecules with embedded
peptide-like bonds are thus important for the understanding of protein
formation in space. Here we report the first tentative detection of
propionamide (C2H5CONH2), the largest peptide-like molecule detected in space
toward Sagittarius B2(N1) at a position called N1E that is slightly offset from
the continuum peak. A new laboratory measurements of the propionamide spectrum
were carried out in the 9-461 GHz, which provide good opportunity to check
directly for the transition frequencies of detected interstellar lines of
propionamide. Our observing result indicates that propionamide emission comes
from the warm, compact cores in Sagittarius B2, in which massive protostellars
are forming. The column density of propionamide toward Sgr B2(N1E) was derived
to be 1.5\times 10^{16} cm^-2, which is three fifths of that of acetamide, and
one nineteenth of that of formamide. This detection suggests that large
peptide-like molecules can form and survive during star-forming process and may
form more complex molecules in the interstellar medium. The detection of
propionamide bodes well for the presence of polypeptides, as well as other
complex prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the rotational structure of propionamide, a complex organic molecule, in the millimeter and submillimeter wave ranges using ALMA observations. They want to improve upon previous studies that have limited information on the molecular structure of propionamide at these wavelengths.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for studying the rotational structure of propionamide was limited to a few low-resolution observations in the millimeter wave range. This paper improved upon that by providing high-resolution observations in the submillimeter range, which enabled the identification of new transitions and the determination of more accurate positions and intensities of known transitions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted ALMA observations of propionamide towards two sources, Sgr B2(N1E) and Sgr B2(N1), in the millimeter and submillimeter wave ranges. They also analyzed existing data from the literature to improve their understanding of the molecular structure of propionamide.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables A1-A4 were referenced in the text most frequently.

Finally, Table A4 shows the results of calculations for the (v29, v30) = (1,0) state.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Ho and Muller (1978)" was cited the most frequently, primarily in the context of discussing the microwave and millimeter-wave spectra of propionamide.</p>

These observations can help improve our understanding of the chemical processes that occur in the ISM and how they affect the distribution of molecules like propionamide.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper is limited to studying the rotational structure of propionamide towards two specific sources, Sgr B2(N1E) and Sgr B2(N1). Future studies could explore the molecular structure of propionamide in other astrophysical environments. Additionally, while the authors provide high-resolution observations in the submillimeter range, more detailed models of the molecular structure may be required to fully interpret the observed transitions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar systems are often formed through the collapse of dense molecular
clouds which, in turn, return copious amounts of atomic and molecular material
to the interstellar medium. An in-depth understanding of chemical evolution
during this cyclic interaction between the stars and the interstellar medium is
at the heart of astrochemistry. Systematic chemical composition changes as
interstellar clouds evolve from the diffuse stage to dense, quiescent molecular
clouds to star-forming regions and proto-planetary disks further enrich the
molecular diversity leading to the evolution of ever more complex molecules. In
particular, the icy mantles formed on interstellar dust grains and their
irradiation are thought to be the origin of many of the observed molecules,
including those that are deemed to be prebiotic; that is those molecules
necessary for the origin of life. This review will discuss both observational
(e.g., ALMA, SOFIA, Herschel) and laboratory investigations using millimeter,
submillimeter, and terahertz and far-IR (THz/F-IR) spectroscopies and the role
that they play in contributing to our understanding of the formation of
prebiotic molecules. Mid-IR spectroscopy has typically been the primary tool
used in laboratory studies. However, THz/F-IR spectroscopy offers an additional
and complementary approach in that it provides the ability to investigate
intermolecular interactions compared to the intramolecular modes available in
the mid-IR. THz/F-IR spectroscopy is still somewhat under-utilized, but with
the additional capability it brings, its popularity is likely to significantly
increase in the near future. This review will discuss the strengths and
limitations of such methods, and will also provide some suggestions on future
research areas that should be pursued in the coming decade exploiting both
space-borne and laboratory facilities.</p>
