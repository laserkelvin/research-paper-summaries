          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for challenging
catalytic transformations due to their well-defined structures and high degree
of synthetic tunability. These features, at least in principle, make MOFs
ideally suited for a computational approach towards catalyst design and
discovery. Nonetheless, the widespread use of data science and machine learning
to accelerate the discovery of MOF catalysts has yet to be substantially
realized. In this review, we provide an overview of recent work that sets the
stage for future high-throughput computational screening and machine learning
studies involving MOF catalysts. This is followed by a discussion of several
challenges currently facing the broad adoption of data-centric approaches in
MOF computational catalysis, and we share possible solutions that can help
propel the field forward.</p>

          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to leverage community knowledge and machine learning models to simplify the engineering of stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works have primarily relied on manual experimental trial-and-error methods or simplistic modeling approaches, which are time-consuming and often lead to suboptimal designs. This paper introduces MOFSimplify, a machine learning framework that leverages extracted stability data of over 3,000 MOFs to predict the most stable structures for a given set of building blocks, improving upon the previous state of the art by orders of magnitude.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose the use of machine learning models and extracting stability data from literature to simplify MOF engineering. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments using a subset of 100 MOFs.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 3 and 4, and Tables 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 3 shows the architecture of MOFSimplify, while Figure 4 illustrates the prediction accuracy of their approach. Table 2 presents the distribution of MOF stability data, and Table 3 displays the comparison of prediction accuracy between MOFSimplify and traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (57) by Coudert et al. is cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of materials databases and their importance for materials science research. The authors also mention other relevant works, such as (58) by Wilkinson et al., which discusses the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper presents a novel approach to simplify MOF engineering through machine learning models and extracted stability data, which could greatly accelerate the discovery of new MOFs with improved properties. The proposed framework has the potential to enable more efficient and effective material design and development in various fields, such as catalysis, sensors, and energy storage.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on the quality and availability of stability data for MOFs, which can be challenging to obtain due to the complex synthesis and characterization processes involved. Additionally, they mention that their framework may not always predict the most stable structure, as the accuracy of machine learning models can depend on the dataset used for training.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No, a link to the Github code is not provided in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
