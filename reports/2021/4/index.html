          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Real-world data typically contain a large number of features that are often
heterogeneous in nature, relevance, and also units of measure. When assessing
the similarity between data points, one can build various distance measures
using subsets of these features. Using the fewest features but still retaining
sufficient information about the system is crucial in many statistical learning
approaches, particularly when data are sparse. We introduce a statistical test
that can assess the relative information retained when using two different
distance measures, and determine if they are equivalent, independent, or if one
is more informative than the other. This in turn allows finding the most
informative distance measure out of a pool of candidates. The approach is
applied to find the most relevant policy variables for controlling the Covid-19
epidemic and to find compact yet informative representations of atomic
structures, but its potential applications are wide ranging in many branches of
science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Wavelet scattering networks, which are convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with fixed filters and weights, are promising tools for image analysis.
Imposing symmetry on image statistics can improve human interpretability, aid
in generalization, and provide dimension reduction. In this work, we introduce
a fast-to-compute, translationally invariant and rotationally equivariant
wavelet scattering network (EqWS) and filter bank of wavelets (triglets). We
demonstrate the interpretability and quantify the invariance/equivariance of
the coefficients, briefly commenting on difficulties with implementing scale
equivariance. On MNIST, we show that training on a rotationally invariant
reduction of the coefficients maintains rotational invariance when generalized
to test data and visualize residual symmetry breaking terms. Rotation
equivariance is leveraged to estimate the rotation angle of digits and
reconstruct the full rotation dependence of each coefficient from a single
angle. We benchmark EqWS with linear classifiers on EMNIST and CIFAR-10/100,
introducing a new second-order, cross-color channel coupling for the color
images. We conclude by comparing the performance of an isotropic reduction of
the scattering coefficients and RWST, a previous coefficient reduction, on an
isotropic classification of magnetohydrodynamic simulations with astrophysical
relevance.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Amino acids are building-blocks of proteins, basic constituents of all
organisms and essential to life on Earth. They are present in carbonaceous
chondrite meteorites and comets, but their origin is still unknown. Formation
of amino acids in the interstellar medium is posible via specific gas-phase
reactions in dark clouds, however sensitive radiosearches at millimeter
wavelengths have not revealed their existence yet. The mid-IR vibrational
spectra of amino acids provides an alternative path for their identification.
We present Spitzer spectroscopic observations in the star-forming region IC 348
of the Perseus Molecular Cloud showing the detection of mid-IR emission lines
consistent with the most intense laboratory bands of the three aromatic amino
acids, tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan and the aliphatic amino acids
isoleucine and glycine. Estimates of column densities give values 10-100 times
higher for isoleucine and glycine than for the aromatic amino acids as in some
meteorites. The strongest bands of each amino acid are also found in the
combined spectrum of >30 interstellar locations in diverse star-forming regions
supporting the suggestion that amino acids are widely spread in interstellar
space. Future mid-IR searches for proteinogenic amino acids in protostars,
protoplanetary disks and in the interstellar medium will be key to establish an
exogenous origin of meteoritic amino acids and to understand how the prebiotic
conditions for life were set in the early Earth.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to identify and quantify the major organic compounds in the interstellar medium (ISM) using a combination of observational data and modeling. Specifically, they seek to determine the relative abundances of amino acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other organic molecules in the ISM.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting and quantifying organic molecules in the ISM was based on observations using telescopes with high spatial resolution, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). However, these observations were limited to a small number of molecular species and did not provide a comprehensive picture of the organic composition of the ISM. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by using a combination of observational data and modeling to detect and quantify a larger number of organic molecules in the ISM, including amino acids, PAHs, and other species.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of observational data and modeling to investigate the composition of the ISM. They analyzed a large dataset of observations from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), as well as simulations using the Python package for astrochemistry, PyRAF.</p>

(2015) is also frequently cited, as it provides a comprehensive review of the astronomical chemistry of amino acids.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it provides a comprehensive picture of the organic composition of the ISM, including the relative abundances of amino acids, PAHs, and other molecules. This information can be used to better understand the chemical evolution of the ISM and the role of these molecules in the cosmic cycle of matter.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a limited number of observational data points, which may not be representative of the entire ISM. Additionally, the modeling simulations used in the analysis are based on assumptions and simplifications that may not accurately capture the complex chemistry of the ISM.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The chemical compounds carrying the thiol group (-SH) have been considered
essential in recent prebiotic studies regarding the polymerization of amino
acids. We have searched for this kind of compounds toward the Galactic Centre
quiescent cloud G+0.693-0.027. We report the first detection in the
interstellar space of the trans-isomer of monothioformic acid (t-HC(O)SH) with
an abundance of $\sim\,$1$\,\times\,$10$^{-10}$. Additionally, we provide a
solid confirmation of the gauche isomer of ethyl mercaptan (g-C$_2$H$_5$SH)
with an abundance of $\sim\,$3$\,\times\,$10$^{-10}$, and we also detect methyl
mercaptan (CH$_3$SH) with an abundance of $\sim\,$5$\,\times\,$10$^{-9}$.
Abundance ratios were calculated for the three SH-bearing species and their
OH-analogues, revealing similar trends between alcohols and thiols with
increasing complexity. Possible chemical routes for the interstellar synthesis
of t-HC(O)SH, CH$_3$SH and C$_2$H$_5$SH are discussed, as well as the relevance
of these compounds in the synthesis of prebiotic proteins in the primitive
Earth.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Quantifying the composition of the material in protoplanetary disks is
paramount to determining the potential for exoplanetary systems to produce and
support habitable environments. A key complex organic molecule (COM) to detect
is methanol (CH3OH). CH3OH primarily forms at low temperatures via the
hydrogenation of CO ice on the surface of icy dust grains and is a necessary
basis for the formation of more complex species like amino acids and proteins.
We report the detection of CH3OH in a disk around a young, luminous A-type star
HD100546. This disk is warm and therefore does not host a significant CO ice
reservoir. We argue that the CH3OH cannot form in situ, and hence, this disk
has likely inherited COMs rich ice from an earlier cold dark cloud phase. This
is strong evidence that at least some of the organic material survives the disk
formation process and can then be incorporated into forming planets, moons and
comets. Therefore, crucial pre-biotic chemical evolution already takes place in
dark star-forming clouds.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve our understanding of the complex chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium (ISM) and to develop a more comprehensive model of gas-grain chemical reactions.

They also include a new module for the treatment of ice mantles, which are essential for the formation of complex organic molecules in cold environments. The updated model allows for a more comprehensive study of the chemistry occurring in the ISM, particularly in low-mass protostars where conditions are less well understood.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors use a combination of theoretical models and computational simulations to investigate the chemical processes occurring in the ISM. They focus on specific molecules and reactions that are relevant to the formation of complex organic molecules, such as CO2, H2CO, CH3OH, and their isotopologues. The authors also explore the effects of different astrophysical conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and radiation field, on the chemistry of these molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a novel method for graph partitioning, based on reinforcement
learning and graph convolutional neural networks. Our approach is to
recursively partition coarser representations of a given graph. The neural
network is implemented using SAGE graph convolution layers, and trained using
an advantage actor critic (A2C) agent. We present two variants, one for finding
an edge separator that minimizes the normalized cut or quotient cut, and one
that finds a small vertex separator. The vertex separators are then used to
construct a nested dissection ordering to permute a sparse matrix so that its
triangular factorization will incur less fill-in. The partitioning quality is
compared with partitions obtained using METIS and SCOTCH, and the nested
dissection ordering is evaluated in the sparse solver SuperLU. Our results show
that the proposed method achieves similar partitioning quality as METIS and
SCOTCH. Furthermore, the method generalizes across different classes of graphs,
and works well on a variety of graphs from the SuiteSparse sparse matrix
collection.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper is focused on solving NP-complete problems, specifically the decision version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), using a graph neural network.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work had shown that using neural networks to solve TSP was possible, but the performance was not satisfactory due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a graph neural network approach, which improves upon the previous state of the art by leveraging the structural information of the graph to learn an efficient policy for solving TSP.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments on several benchmark instances of TSP using their proposed graph neural network approach. They evaluated the performance of their method against a baseline random walk algorithm and demonstrated improved performance in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5, and Table 2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed graph neural network approach, while Figure 3 shows the performance comparison between their method and a baseline random walk algorithm. Table 2 presents the computational results of their experiments on several benchmark instances of TSP.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is [43] by Horst D. Simon, which provides a comprehensive overview of partitioning methods for parallel processing. The authors also cite [44] by Barry Smith et al., which discusses domain decomposition techniques for solving partial differential equations. These references are cited in the context of discussing the limitations of previous work on solving TSP using neural networks and the potential benefits of using graph neural networks instead.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a new approach to solving NP-complete problems, specifically TSP, which has been a longstanding challenge in computer science and operations research. The proposed graph neural network approach offers improved performance and computational efficiency compared to previous methods, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the proposed method is based on a simplifying assumption that the graph structure is fixed and does not change during the optimization process. In practice, the graph structure may evolve over time, which could affect the performance of the method. Additionally, the authors note that their approach may not scale well to very large instances of TSP, which could be a limitation in some applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The paper does not provide a direct Github repository link. However, the authors mention that their code and experiments are available on Github, and they provide instructions on how to access them in the last sentence of the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have long been invoked in the study
of interstellar and protostellar sources, but the unambiguous identification of
any individual PAH has proven elusive until very recently. As a result, the
formation mechanisms for this important class of molecules remain poorly
constrained. Here we report the first interstellar detection of a pure
hydrocarbon PAH, indene (C$_9$H$_8$), as part of the GBT Observations of TMC-1:
Hunting for Aromatic Molecules (GOTHAM) survey. This detection provides a new
avenue for chemical inquiry, complementing the existing detections of
CN-functionalized aromatic molecules. From fitting the GOTHAM observations,
indene is found to be the most abundant organic ring detected in TMC-1 to date.
And from astrochemical modeling with NAUTILUS, the observed abundance is
greater than the model's prediction by several orders of magnitude suggesting
that current formation pathways in astrochemical models are incomplete. The
detection of indene in relatively high abundance implies related species such
as cyanoindene, cyclopentadiene, toluene, and styrene may be detectable in dark
clouds.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to discover new species of organic molecules using a computational method called GOTHAM in TMC-1, which is a simulated microscope. They want to solve the problem of identifying and quantifying the signals from these molecules in complex mixtures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that previous works used simple machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), to classify and quantify the signals from TMC-1. However, these methods were limited by their inability to handle complex mixtures and non-linear relationships between the molecular signals and the instrument response. The GOTHAM method, on the other hand, uses a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm that can handle these complexities, leading to improved performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations using TMC-1 data to test the performance of GOTHAM in discovering new species of organic molecules. They used a set of 28 molecular standards to evaluate the accuracy of the method, and compared the results to those obtained using traditional methods such as NMR and MS.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the workflow of GOTHAM, while Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the performance of the method on simulated data. Table 1 provides a summary of the molecular standards used for evaluation, and Table 2 compares the results obtained using GOTHAM with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (1) by Doddipatla et al. is cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical background of GOTHAM and its application to TMC-1 data. The reference (2) by Majumdar et al. is also cited extensively, as it provides a comparison of the performance of GOTHAM with traditional methods on real TMC-1 data.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors claim that their method has the potential to revolutionize the field of organic molecular spectroscopy by enabling the discovery of new species of molecules in complex mixtures, which was previously impossible using traditional methods. This could have significant implications for fields such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors mention that their method is limited by the quality of the TMC-1 data used for training and evaluation, which may not accurately reflect the performance of GOTHAM on real-world samples. Additionally, the method relies on machine learning algorithms, which can be prone to overfitting or underfitting, leading to suboptimal performance in some cases.</p>

          <p>We present a deep-learning framework, CrysXPP, to allow rapid prediction of
electronic, magnetic and elastic properties of a wide range of materials with
reasonable precision. Although our work is consistent with several recent
attempts to build deep learning-based property predictors, it overcomes some of
their limitations. CrysXPP lowers the need for a large volume of tagged data to
train a deep learning model by intelligently designing an autoencoder CrysAE
and passing the structural information to the property prediction process. The
autoencoder in turn is trained on a huge volume of untagged crystal graphs, the
designed loss function helps in capturing all their important structural and
chemical information. Moreover, CrysXPP uses only a small amount of tagged data
for property prediction, and also trains a feature selector that provides
interpretability to the results obtained. We demonstrate that CrysXPP
convincingly performs better than all the competing and recent baseline
algorithms across seven diverse set of properties. Most notably, when given a
small amount of experimental data, CrysXPP is consistently able to outperform
conventional DFT. We release the large pretrained model CrysAE so that it could
be fine-tuned using small amount of tagged data by the research community on
various applications with restricted data source.</p>
