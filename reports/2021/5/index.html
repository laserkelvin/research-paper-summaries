          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The unusual infrared emission patterns of CH$^+$, recently detected in the
planetary nebula NGC 7027, are examined theoretically with high-accuracy
rovibrational wavefunctions and $ab$ $initio$ dipole moment curves. The
calculated transition dipole moments quantitatively reproduce the observed
$J$-dependent intensity variation, which is ascribed to underlying centrifugal
distortion-induced interference effects. We discuss the implications of this
anomalous behavior for astrochemical modeling of CH$^+$ production and
excitation, and provide a simple expression to estimate the magnitude of this
effect for other light diatomic molecules with small dipole derivatives.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We discuss the detection of 14 rovibrational lines of CH$^+$, obtained with
the iSHELL spectrograph on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on
Maunakea. Our observations in the 3.49 - 4.13 $\mu$m spectral region, obtained
with a 0.375" slit width that provided a spectral resolving power
$\lambda/\Delta \lambda \sim 80,000$, have resulted in the unequivocal
detection of the $R(0) - R(3)$ and $P(1)-P(10)$ transitions within the $v=1-0$
band of CH$^+$. The $R$-branch transitions are anomalously weak relative to the
$P$-branch transitions, a behavior that is explained accurately by rovibronic
calculations of the transition dipole moment reported in a companion paper
(Changala et al. 2021). Nine infrared transitions of H$_2$ were also detected
in these observations, comprising the $S(8)$, $S(9)$, $S(13)$ and $S(15)$ pure
rotational lines; the $v=1-0$ $O(4) - O(7)$ lines, and the $v=2-1$ $O(5)$ line.
We present a photodissociation region model, constrained by the CH$^+$ and
H$_2$ line fluxes that we measured, that includes a detailed treatment of the
excitation of CH$^+$ by inelastic collisions, optical pumping, and chemical
("formation") pumping. The latter process is found to dominate the excitation
of the observed rovibrational lines of CH$^+$, and the model is remarkably
successful in explaining both the absolute and relative strengths of the CH$^+$
and H$_2$ lines.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a simple and accurate recipe for computing the occupation probabilities of rovibrational states of CH+, which is a radical in chemical reactions. They want to improve upon existing methods that are either too complex or too simplistic.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that existing recipes for computing occupation probabilities of CH+ rely on simplified assumptions, such as neglecting the dependence of p(v', J') on the rotational state of H2. They also cite a study by F17 that provides a more accurate calculation of the occupation probabilities but is computationally expensive. The current paper proposes a new recipe that captures the strong dependences of p(v', J') on the total energy balance of reaction 2 and on the kinetic temperature, while being relatively simple to compute.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors did not conduct any new experiments for this study. Instead, they focused on developing a new recipe for computing occupation probabilities of CH+ based on a set of assumptions that are more accurate than previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 15 and Tables 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 15 shows the probability distributions of forming CH+ in its rovibrational levels as a function of the level energy ECH+(v', J'), which is the main result of the paper. Table 2 lists the parameters used in the recipe, while Table 3 provides some benchmark calculations for comparison purposes.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite F17 the most frequently, as they want to compare their results with those obtained using a more accurate calculation. They mention that F17 provides a more detailed analysis of the occupation probabilities of CH+ but is computationally expensive, while their proposed recipe is simpler and more practical for large-scale calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed recipe could be useful in understanding the chemical reactions involving CH+, which are important in atmospheric chemistry and astrochemistry. They also mention that their approach could be applied to other radicals with complex vibrational structures, potentially leading to a better understanding of their occupation probabilities and chemical reactivity.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed recipe is based on simplifying assumptions, such as neglecting the dependence of p(v', J') on the rotational state of H2. They also mention that their approach may not be as accurate as more advanced calculations using quantum mechanics or molecular dynamics.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a Github repository link for this paper, as it is a research article published in a journal and not a software project hosted on Github.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Phosphine is now well established as a biosignature, which has risen to
prominence with its recent tentative detection on Venus. To follow up this
discovery and related future exoplanet biosignature detections, it is important
to spectroscopically detect the presence of phosphorus-bearing atmospheric
molecules that could be involved in the chemical networks producing, destroying
or reacting with phosphine. We start by enumerating phosphorus-bearing
molecules (P-molecules) that could potentially be detected spectroscopically in
planetary atmospheres and collecting all available spectral data. Gaseous
P-molecules are rare, with speciation information scarce. Very few molecules
have high accuracy spectral data from experiment or theory; instead, the best
available data is from the RASCALL approach and obtained using functional group
theory. Here, we present a high-throughput approach utilising established
computational quantum chemistry methods (CQC) to produce a database of
approximate infrared spectra for 958 P-molecules. These data are of interest
for astronomy and astrochemistry (importantly identifying potential ambiguities
in molecular assignments), improving RASCALL's underlying data, big data
spectral analysis and future machine learning applications. However, this data
will probably not be sufficiently accurate for secure experimental detections
of specific molecules within complex gaseous mixtures in laboratory or
astronomy settings.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) is one of the major cosmic dust components in
carbon-rich environments. However, the formation of SiC dust is not well
understood. In particular, the initial stages of the SiC condensation (i.e. the
SiC nucleation) remain unclear, as the basic building blocks (i.e. molecular
clusters) exhibit atomic segregation at the (sub-)nanoscale. We report vertical
and adiabatic ionization energies of small silicon carbide clusters, (SiC)$_n$
, n=2-12, ranging from 6.6-10.0 eV, which are lower than for the SiC molecule
($\sim$ 10.6 eV). The most favorable structures of the singly ionized
(SiC)$_n^+$, n=5-12, cations resemble their neutral counterparts. However, for
sizes n=2-4, these structural analogues are metastable and different cation
geometries are favored. Moreover, we find that the (SiC)$_5^+$ cation is likely
to be a transition state. Therefore, we place constraints on the stability
limit for small, neutral (SiC)$_n$ clusters to persist ionization through
(inter)-stellar radiation fields or high temperatures.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a comprehensive methodology to enable addition of van der Waals
(vdW) corrections to machine learning (ML) atomistic force fields. Using a
Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) [Bart\'ok et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,
136403 (2010)] as baseline, we accurately machine learn a local model of atomic
polarizabilities based on Hirshfeld volume partitioning of the charge density
[Tkatchenko and Scheffler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)]. These
environment-dependent polarizabilities are then used to parametrize a screened
London-dispersion approximation to the vdW interactions. Our ML vdW model only
needs to learn the charge density partitioning implicitly, by learning the
reference Hirshfeld volumes from density functional theory (DFT). In practice,
we can predict accurate Hirshfeld volumes from the knowledge of the local
atomic environment (atomic positions) alone, making the model highly
computationally efficient. For additional efficiency, our ML model of atomic
polarizabilities reuses the same many-body atomic descriptors used for the
underlying GAP learning of bonded interatomic interactions. We also show how
the method enables straightforward computation of gradients of the observables,
even when these remain challenging for the reference method (e.g., calculating
gradients of the Hirshfeld volumes in DFT). Finally, we demonstrate the
approach by studying the phase diagram of C$_{60}$, where vdW effects are
important. The need for a highly accurate vdW-inclusive reactive force field is
highlighted by modeling the decomposition of the C$_{60}$ molecules taking
place at high pressures and temperatures.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper presents a review of ideas that interconnect Astrochemistry and
Galactic Dynamics. Since these two areas are vast and not recent, each one has
already been covered separately by several reviews. After a general historical
introduction, and a needed quick review of processes like the stellar
nucleosynthesis which gives the base to understand the interstellar formation
of simple chemical compounds (H2, CO, NH3 and H2O), we focus on a number of
topics which are at the crossing of the two areas, Dynamics and Astrochemistry.
Astrochemistry is a flourishing field which intends to study the presence and
formation of molecules as well as the influence of them into the structure,
evolution and dynamics of astronomical objects. The progress in the knowledge
on the existence of new complex molecules and of their process of formation
originates from the observational, experimental and theoretical areas which
compose the field. The interfacing areas include star formation, protoplanetary
disks, the role of the spiral arms and the chemical abundance gradients in the
galactic disk. It often happens that the physical conditions in some regions of
the ISM are only revealed by means of molecular observations. To organise a
classification of chemical evolution processes, we discuss about how
astrochemistry can act in three different contexts: i. the chemistry of the
early universe, including external galaxies, ii. star forming regions, and iii.
AGB stars and circumstellar envelopes. We mention that our research is
stimulated by plans for instruments and projects, such as the on-going LLAMA,
which consists in the construction of a 12m sub-mm radio telescope in the
Andes. Thus, modern and new facilities can play a key role in new discoveries
not only in astrochemistry but also in radio astronomy and related areas.
Furthermore, the research of the origin of life is also a stimulating
perspective.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>    Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
    A: The paper aims to investigate the abundances of carbon-rich molecules in circumstellar envelopes, specifically focusing on C2H4O2 isomers.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
    A: Previous studies have shown that C2H4O2 is present in circumstellar envelopes, but there was limited knowledge on the abundance ratios of the three isomers (crys-trans-stereoisomer, cis-trans-stereoisomer, and trans-stereoisomer). This paper improved upon the previous state of the art by using ALMA to observe the spatial distribution of these isomers towards Sgr B2(N), providing new insights into their abundance ratios.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
    A: The authors conducted ALMA observations of the C2H4O2 isomers in the circumstellar envelope of Sgr B2(N). They used a variety of techniques, such as spectroscopic imaging and velocity-resolved spectroscopy, to study the spatial distribution of these molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
    A: Figures 1, 3, and Tables 2 and 4 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the ALMA observations of C2H4O2 isomers towards Sgr B2(N), while Table 2 presents the abundance ratios of these isomers.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
    A: The reference "Yeh and Lim (2007)" was cited the most frequently, as it provides a background on the synthetic chemistry of C2H4O2 isomers. The authors mentioned this reference in the context of discussing the possible formation mechanisms of these molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
    A: This study provides new insights into the abundance ratios of C2H4O2 isomers in circumstellar envelopes, which can help elucidate their formation mechanisms and provide a better understanding of the chemistry of these environments. The authors suggest that these findings could have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
    A: One potential weakness of the study is that it is based on observations of a single star (Sgr B2(N)), which may not be representative of all carbon-rich stars. Additionally, the authors note that further studies are needed to confirm their findings and explore the abundance ratios of these isomers in other circumstellar environments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Widespread adoption of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
cells (HT-PEMFCs) and HT-PEM electrochemical hydrogen pumps (HT-PEM ECHPs)
requires models and computational tools that provide accurate scale-up and
optimization. Knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming
and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g.,
material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials).
Data-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often
necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this
contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are uniquely
combined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based
model originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data
(887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model.
Furthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied
to HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar
materials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and
HT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points
each) were used to train 8 target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data
reached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE between 1.04 and 3.73% for HT-PEMCs
and between 6.38 and 8.46% for HT-PEM ECHPs).</p>
