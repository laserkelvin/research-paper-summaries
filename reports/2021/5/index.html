          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The unusual infrared emission patterns of CH$^+$, recently detected in the
planetary nebula NGC 7027, are examined theoretically with high-accuracy
rovibrational wavefunctions and $ab$ $initio$ dipole moment curves. The
calculated transition dipole moments quantitatively reproduce the observed
$J$-dependent intensity variation, which is ascribed to underlying centrifugal
distortion-induced interference effects. We discuss the implications of this
anomalous behavior for astrochemical modeling of CH$^+$ production and
excitation, and provide a simple expression to estimate the magnitude of this
effect for other light diatomic molecules with small dipole derivatives.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We discuss the detection of 14 rovibrational lines of CH$^+$, obtained with
the iSHELL spectrograph on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on
Maunakea. Our observations in the 3.49 - 4.13 $\mu$m spectral region, obtained
with a 0.375" slit width that provided a spectral resolving power
$\lambda/\Delta \lambda \sim 80,000$, have resulted in the unequivocal
detection of the $R(0) - R(3)$ and $P(1)-P(10)$ transitions within the $v=1-0$
band of CH$^+$. The $R$-branch transitions are anomalously weak relative to the
$P$-branch transitions, a behavior that is explained accurately by rovibronic
calculations of the transition dipole moment reported in a companion paper
(Changala et al. 2021). Nine infrared transitions of H$_2$ were also detected
in these observations, comprising the $S(8)$, $S(9)$, $S(13)$ and $S(15)$ pure
rotational lines; the $v=1-0$ $O(4) - O(7)$ lines, and the $v=2-1$ $O(5)$ line.
We present a photodissociation region model, constrained by the CH$^+$ and
H$_2$ line fluxes that we measured, that includes a detailed treatment of the
excitation of CH$^+$ by inelastic collisions, optical pumping, and chemical
("formation") pumping. The latter process is found to dominate the excitation
of the observed rovibrational lines of CH$^+$, and the model is remarkably
successful in explaining both the absolute and relative strengths of the CH$^+$
and H$_2$ lines.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a simple and accurate recipe for computing the occupation probabilities of rovibrational states of CH+, which is a radical in chemical reactions. They want to improve upon existing methods that are either too complex or too simplistic.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that existing recipes for computing occupation probabilities of CH+ rely on simplified assumptions, such as neglecting the dependence of p(v', J') on the rotational state of H2. They also cite a study by F17 that provides a more accurate calculation of the occupation probabilities but is computationally expensive. The current paper proposes a new recipe that captures the strong dependences of p(v', J') on the total energy balance of reaction 2 and on the kinetic temperature, while being relatively simple to compute.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors did not conduct any new experiments for this study. Instead, they focused on developing a new recipe for computing occupation probabilities of CH+ based on a set of assumptions that are more accurate than previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 15 and Tables 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 15 shows the probability distributions of forming CH+ in its rovibrational levels as a function of the level energy ECH+(v', J'), which is the main result of the paper. Table 2 lists the parameters used in the recipe, while Table 3 provides some benchmark calculations for comparison purposes.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite F17 the most frequently, as they want to compare their results with those obtained using a more accurate calculation. They mention that F17 provides a more detailed analysis of the occupation probabilities of CH+ but is computationally expensive, while their proposed recipe is simpler and more practical for large-scale calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed recipe could be useful in understanding the chemical reactions involving CH+, which are important in atmospheric chemistry and astrochemistry. They also mention that their approach could be applied to other radicals with complex vibrational structures, potentially leading to a better understanding of their occupation probabilities and chemical reactivity.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed recipe is based on simplifying assumptions, such as neglecting the dependence of p(v', J') on the rotational state of H2. They also mention that their approach may not be as accurate as more advanced calculations using quantum mechanics or molecular dynamics.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a Github repository link for this paper, as it is a research article published in a journal and not a software project hosted on Github.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Phosphine is now well established as a biosignature, which has risen to
prominence with its recent tentative detection on Venus. To follow up this
discovery and related future exoplanet biosignature detections, it is important
to spectroscopically detect the presence of phosphorus-bearing atmospheric
molecules that could be involved in the chemical networks producing, destroying
or reacting with phosphine. We start by enumerating phosphorus-bearing
molecules (P-molecules) that could potentially be detected spectroscopically in
planetary atmospheres and collecting all available spectral data. Gaseous
P-molecules are rare, with speciation information scarce. Very few molecules
have high accuracy spectral data from experiment or theory; instead, the best
available data is from the RASCALL approach and obtained using functional group
theory. Here, we present a high-throughput approach utilising established
computational quantum chemistry methods (CQC) to produce a database of
approximate infrared spectra for 958 P-molecules. These data are of interest
for astronomy and astrochemistry (importantly identifying potential ambiguities
in molecular assignments), improving RASCALL's underlying data, big data
spectral analysis and future machine learning applications. However, this data
will probably not be sufficiently accurate for secure experimental detections
of specific molecules within complex gaseous mixtures in laboratory or
astronomy settings.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) is one of the major cosmic dust components in
carbon-rich environments. However, the formation of SiC dust is not well
understood. In particular, the initial stages of the SiC condensation (i.e. the
SiC nucleation) remain unclear, as the basic building blocks (i.e. molecular
clusters) exhibit atomic segregation at the (sub-)nanoscale. We report vertical
and adiabatic ionization energies of small silicon carbide clusters, (SiC)$_n$
, n=2-12, ranging from 6.6-10.0 eV, which are lower than for the SiC molecule
($\sim$ 10.6 eV). The most favorable structures of the singly ionized
(SiC)$_n^+$, n=5-12, cations resemble their neutral counterparts. However, for
sizes n=2-4, these structural analogues are metastable and different cation
geometries are favored. Moreover, we find that the (SiC)$_5^+$ cation is likely
to be a transition state. Therefore, we place constraints on the stability
limit for small, neutral (SiC)$_n$ clusters to persist ionization through
(inter)-stellar radiation fields or high temperatures.</p>
