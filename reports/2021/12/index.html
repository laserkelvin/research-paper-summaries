          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH, MM) has been identified through gas-phase
signatures in both high- and low-mass star-forming regions. This molecule is
expected to form upon hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions in CO-rich
ice through radical recombination of CO hydrogenation products. The goal of
this work is to investigate experimentally and theoretically the most likely
solid-state MM reaction channel -- the recombination of CH2OH and CH3O radicals
-- for dark interstellar cloud conditions and to compare the formation
efficiency with that of other species that were shown to form along the
CO-hydrogenation line. Hydrogen atoms and CO or H2CO molecules are co-deposited
on top of the predeposited H2O ice to mimic the conditions associated with the
beginning of 'rapid' CO freeze-out. Quadrupole mass spectrometry is used to
analyze the gas-phase COM composition following a temperature programmed
desorption. Monte Carlo simulations are used for an astrochemical model
comparing the MM formation efficiency with that of other COMs. Unambiguous
detection of newly formed MM has been possible both in CO+H and H2CO+H
experiments. The resulting abundance of MM with respect to CH3OH is about 0.05,
which is about 6 times less than the value observed toward NGC 6334I and about
3 times less than the value reported for IRAS 16293B. The results of
astrochemical simulations predict a similar value for the MM abundance with
respect to CH3OH factors ranging between 0.06 to 0.03. We find that MM is
formed by co-deposition of CO and H2CO with H atoms through the recombination
of CH2OH and CH3O radicals. In both the experimental and modeling studies, the
efficiency of this channel alone is not sufficient to explain the observed
abundance of MM. These results indicate an incomplete knowledge of the reaction
network or the presence of alternative solid-state or gas-phase formation
mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We developed an operational solar flare prediction model using deep neural
networks, named Deep Flare Net (DeFN). DeFN can issue probabilistic forecasts
of solar flares in two categories, such as >=M-class and <M-class events or
>=C-class and <C-class events, occurring in the next 24 h after observations
and the maximum class of flares occurring in the next 24 h. DeFN is set to run
every 6 h and has been operated since January 2019. The input database of solar
observation images taken by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is downloaded
from the data archive operated by the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) of
Stanford University. Active regions are automatically detected from
magnetograms, and 79 features are extracted from each region nearly in real
time using multiwavelength observation data. Flare labels are attached to the
feature database, and then, the database is standardized and input into DeFN
for prediction. DeFN was pretrained using the datasets obtained from 2010 to
2015. The model was evaluated with the skill score of the true skill statistics
(TSS) and achieved predictions with TSS = 0.80 for >=M-class flares and TSS =
0.63 for >=C-class flares. For comparison, we evaluated the operationally
forecast results from January 2019 to June 2020. We found that operational DeFN
forecasts achieved TSS = 0.70 (0.84) for >=C-class flares with the probability
threshold of 50 (40)%, although there were very few M-class flares during this
period and we should continue monitoring the results for a longer time. Here,
we adopted a chronological split to divide the database into two for training
and testing. The chronological split appears suitable for evaluating
operational models. Furthermore, we proposed the use of time-series
cross-validation. The procedure achieved TSS = 0.70 for >=M-class flares and
0.59 for >=C-class flares using the datasets obtained from 2010 to 2017.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Many atomic descriptors are currently limited by their unfavourable scaling
with the number of chemical elements $S$ e.g. the length of body-ordered
descriptors, such as the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) power
spectrum (3-body) and the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) (multiple
body-orders), scales as $(NS)^\nu$ where $\nu+1$ is the body-order and $N$ is
the number of radial basis functions used in the density expansion. We
introduce two distinct approaches which can be used to overcome this scaling
for the SOAP power spectrum. Firstly, we show that the power spectrum is
amenable to lossless compression with respect to both $S$ and $N$, so that the
descriptor length can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N^2S^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}\left(NS\right)$. Secondly, we introduce a generalized SOAP kernel,
where compression is achieved through the use of the total, element agnostic
density, in combination with radial projection. The ideas used in the
generalized kernel are equally applicably to any other body-ordered descriptors
and we demonstrate this for the Atom Centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF).
Finally, both compression approaches are shown to offer comparable performance
to the original descriptor across a variety of numerical tests.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper reveals a large and all-season ozone hole in the lower
stratosphere over the tropics (30degN-30degS) since the 1980s, where an O3 hole
is defined as an area of O3 loss larger than 25% compared with the undisturbed
atmosphere. The depth of this tropical O3 hole is comparable to that of the
well-known springtime Antarctic O3 hole, whereas its area is about seven times
that of the latter. Similar to the Antarctic O3 hole, approximately 80% of the
normal O3 value is depleted at the center of the tropical O3 hole. The results
strongly indicate that both Antarctic and tropical O3 holes must arise from an
identical physical mechanism, for which the cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction
(CRE) model shows good agreements with observations. The whole-year large
tropical O3 hole could cause a serious global concern as it can lead to
increases in ground-level ultraviolet radiation and affect 50% of Earth's
surface area, home to approximately 50% of the world's population. Moreover,
the presence of the tropical and polar O3 holes is equivalent to the formation
of three 'temperature holes' observed in the stratosphere. These findings will
have significances in understanding planetary physics, ozone depletion, climate
change, and human health.</p>
