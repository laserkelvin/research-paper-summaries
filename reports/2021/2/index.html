          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neutron and X-ray scattering represent two state-of-the-art materials
characterization techniques that measure materials' structural and dynamical
properties with high precision. These techniques play critical roles in
understanding a wide variety of materials systems, from catalysis to polymers,
nanomaterials to macromolecules, and energy materials to quantum materials. In
recent years, neutron and X-ray scattering have received a significant boost
due to the development and increased application of machine learning to
materials problems. This article reviews the recent progress in applying
machine learning techniques to augment various neutron and X-ray scattering
techniques. We highlight the integration of machine learning methods into the
typical workflow of scattering experiments. We focus on scattering problems
that faced challenge with traditional methods but addressable using machine
learning, such as leveraging the knowledge of simple materials to model more
complicated systems, learning with limited data or incomplete labels,
identifying meaningful spectra and materials' representations for learning
tasks, mitigating spectral noise, and many others. We present an outlook on a
few emerging roles machine learning may play in broad types of scattering and
spectroscopic problems in the foreseeable future.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Weight sharing in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ensures that their
feature maps will be translation-equivariant. However, although conventional
convolutions are equivariant to translation, they are not equivariant to other
isometries of the input image data, such as rotation and reflection. For the
classification of astronomical objects such as radio galaxies, which are
expected statistically to be globally orientation invariant, this lack of
dihedral equivariance means that a conventional CNN must learn explicitly to
classify all rotated versions of a particular type of object individually. In
this work we present the first application of group-equivariant convolutional
neural networks to radio galaxy classification and explore their potential for
reducing intra-class variability by preserving equivariance for the Euclidean
group E(2), containing translations, rotations and reflections. For the radio
galaxy classification problem considered here, we find that classification
performance is modestly improved by the use of both cyclic and dihedral models
without additional hyper-parameter tuning, and that a D16 equivariant model
provides the best test performance. We use the Monte Carlo Dropout method as a
Bayesian approximation to recover epistemic uncertainty as a function of image
orientation and show that E(2)-equivariant models are able to reduce variations
in model confidence as a function of rotation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The recent boom in computational chemistry has enabled several projects aimed
at discovering useful materials or catalysts. We acknowledge and address two
recurring issues in the field of computational catalyst discovery. First,
calculating macro-scale catalyst properties is not straight-forward when using
ensembles of atomic-scale calculations (e.g., density functional theory). We
attempt to address this issue by creating a multiscale model that estimates
bulk catalyst activity using adsorption energy predictions from both density
functional theory and machine learning models. The second issue is that many
catalyst discovery efforts seek to optimize catalyst properties, but
optimization is an inherently exploitative objective that is in tension with
the explorative nature of early-stage discovery projects. In other words: why
invest so much time finding a "best" catalyst when it is likely to fail for
some other, unforeseen problem? We address this issue by relaxing the catalyst
discovery goal into a classification problem: "What is the set of catalysts
that is worth testing experimentally?" Here we present a catalyst discovery
method called myopic multiscale sampling, which combines multiscale modeling
with automated selection of density functional theory calculations. It is an
active classification strategy that seeks to classify catalysts as "worth
investigating" or "not worth investigating" experimentally. Our results show a
~7-16 times speedup in catalyst classification relative to random sampling.
These results were based on offline simulations of our algorithm on two
different datasets: a larger, synthesized dataset and a smaller, real dataset.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the state-of-the-art in neural architecture search (NAS) by proposing a new method called "Banana" that uses Bayesian optimization with neural architectures for NAS. Specifically, they aim to find the best combination of architectural parameters and hyperparameters for a given task.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) is an attractive method for
accelerated quantum simulations of condensed matter due to its enhanced
computational efficiency over standard Density Functional Theory approaches.
However, DFTB models can be challenging to determine for individual systems of
interest, especially for metallic and interfacial systems where different
bonding arrangements can lead to significant changes in electronic states. In
this regard, we have created a rapid-screening approach for determining
systematically improvable DFTB interaction potentials that can yield
transferable models for a variety of conditions. Our method leverages a recent
reactive molecular dynamics force field where many-body interactions are
represented by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. This allows for
the efficient creation of multi-center representations with relative ease,
requiring only a small investment in initial DFT calculations. We have focused
our workflow on TiH$_2$ as a model system and show that a relatively small
training set based on unit-cell sized calculations yields a model accurate for
both bulk and surface properties. Our approach is easy to implement and can
yield accurate DFTB models over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions,
where physical and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly
and there is historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for
interpretation and validation of experimental results.</p>

          <p>Using radio observations with the Green Bank Telescope, evidence has now been
found for a second five-membered ring in the dense cloud Taurus Molecular
Cloud-1 (TMC-1). Based on additional observations of an ongoing, large-scale,
high-sensitivity spectral line survey (GOTHAM) at centimeter wavelengths toward
this source, we have used a combination of spectral stacking, Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), and matched filtering techniques to detect
2-cyanocyclopentadiene, a low-lying isomer of 1-cyanocyclopentadiene, which was
recently discovered there by the same methods. The new observational data also
yields a considerably improved detection significance for the more stable
isomer and evidence for several individual transitions between 23 - 32 GHz.
Through our MCMC analysis, we derive total column densities of
$8.3\times10^{11}$ and $1.9\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for 1- and
2-cyanocyclopentadiene respectively, corresponding to a ratio of 4.4(6)
favoring the former. The derived abundance ratios point towards a common
formation pathway - most likely being cyanation of cyclopentadiene by analogy
to benzonitrile.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D dust emission mapping in galaxy environments by developing a novel method based on the 2-cyano-CPD technique. The authors seek to address the limitations of previous methods, which were found to be inaccurate or computationally expensive.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous methods for 3D dust emission mapping relied on single-dish telescope observations and assumed a uniform dust distribution within galaxies. These methods were found to be limited by their inability to account for the complex and variable dust distributions observed in real galaxies. The present study advances the state of the art by introducing a new technique that takes into account the non-uniform dust distribution using 2-cyano-CPD observations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed MCMC simulations to fit the observed data with their model, which consists of four components (C1-C4) representing different regions of the galaxy with varying dust properties. They also tested the performance of their method using a series of simulations with varying input parameters.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A2 and Table A2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide the results of the MCMC analysis and display the best-fit parameters for each component. Figure A1 is also important as it shows the concept of the 2-cyano-CPD technique.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical background for the 2-cyano-CPD technique. The authors also cited [2] and [3] to demonstrate the feasibility of their method and to provide a comparison with previous works, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our understanding of dust properties in galaxies, which is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution and cosmology. The proposed method can also be applied to other observational techniques, such as CO and radio continuum observations, making it a versatile tool for studying galaxy dust emission.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is limited by the assumption of a constant dust-to-gas ratio within each component, which may not be accurate in all cases. They also mention that their method can only provide an average emission pattern for each component, and cannot capture the detailed spatial variations within each region.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Using radio observations with the Green Bank Telescope, evidence has now been
found for a second five-membered ring in the dense cloud Taurus Molecular
Cloud-1 (TMC-1). Based on additional observations of an ongoing, large-scale,
high-sensitivity spectral line survey (GOTHAM) at centimeter wavelengths toward
this source, we have used a combination of spectral stacking, Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), and matched filtering techniques to detect
2-cyanocyclopentadiene, a low-lying isomer of 1-cyanocyclopentadiene, which was
recently discovered there by the same methods. The new observational data also
yields a considerably improved detection significance for the more stable
isomer and evidence for several individual transitions between 23 - 32 GHz.
Through our MCMC analysis, we derive total column densities of
$8.3\times10^{11}$ and $1.9\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for 1- and
2-cyanocyclopentadiene respectively, corresponding to a ratio of 4.4(6)
favoring the former. The derived abundance ratios point towards a common
formation pathway - most likely being cyanation of cyclopentadiene by analogy
to benzonitrile.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constructed natively on the sphere have
been developed recently and shown to be highly effective for the analysis of
spherical data. While an efficient framework has been formulated, spherical
CNNs are nevertheless highly computationally demanding; typically they cannot
scale beyond spherical signals of thousands of pixels. We develop scattering
networks constructed natively on the sphere that provide a powerful
representational space for spherical data. Spherical scattering networks are
computationally scalable and exhibit rotational equivariance, while their
representational space is invariant to isometries and provides efficient and
stable signal representations. By integrating scattering networks as an
additional type of layer in the generalized spherical CNN framework, we show
how they can be leveraged to scale spherical CNNs to the high-resolution data
typical of many practical applications, with spherical signals of many tens of
megapixels and beyond.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper is focused on developing a deep learning model for image denoising tasks, specifically for scenarios where the input images have a large number of channels (e.g., 32 channels for a grayscale image). The authors aim to improve upon the previous state-of-the-art models by leveraging a novel approach called "scattering networks," which enables the model to learn more effectively from the input data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art models for image denoising were based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a small number of learnable parameters. These models were found to be limited in their ability to handle large numbers of input channels, leading to suboptimal performance in scenarios where the input images have a high number of channels. The proposed paper improves upon these models by introducing the concept of "scattering networks," which enables the model to learn more effectively from the input data and achieve better performance in such scenarios.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments using two scenarios: one with a scattering network and another without it. In the first scenario, they used an Adagrad optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and applied L1 regularization with a strength of 10^-5. In the second scenario, they used the same core hybrid model but without the scattering network. They trained both models for 200 epochs and evaluated their performance on a test set of 128 simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2, and Table 2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the proposed model, while Figure 2 illustrates the effectiveness of the scattering network in mixing high-frequency signal content to low frequencies. Table 2 compares the performance of the models with and without a scattering network in terms of peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites the work of Kingma and Ba (2015) the most frequently, as it relates to the Adagrad optimizer used in the experiments. The authors also cite the work of Kondor et al. (2018) related to L1 regularization and batch normalization across fragments.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel approach to image denoising that leverages a scattering network, which enables the model to learn more effectively from the input data. This approach has the potential to significantly improve upon existing models in terms of performance and efficiency, especially for scenarios with a large number of input channels.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed model may suffer from overfitting due to the small number of learnable parameters. They also note that the approach is computationally expensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The paper does not provide a direct Github repository link, but the authors encourage readers to access the code used in their experiments through the corresponding author's website or Github profile.</p>
