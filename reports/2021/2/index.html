          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neutron and X-ray scattering represent two state-of-the-art materials
characterization techniques that measure materials' structural and dynamical
properties with high precision. These techniques play critical roles in
understanding a wide variety of materials systems, from catalysis to polymers,
nanomaterials to macromolecules, and energy materials to quantum materials. In
recent years, neutron and X-ray scattering have received a significant boost
due to the development and increased application of machine learning to
materials problems. This article reviews the recent progress in applying
machine learning techniques to augment various neutron and X-ray scattering
techniques. We highlight the integration of machine learning methods into the
typical workflow of scattering experiments. We focus on scattering problems
that faced challenge with traditional methods but addressable using machine
learning, such as leveraging the knowledge of simple materials to model more
complicated systems, learning with limited data or incomplete labels,
identifying meaningful spectra and materials' representations for learning
tasks, mitigating spectral noise, and many others. We present an outlook on a
few emerging roles machine learning may play in broad types of scattering and
spectroscopic problems in the foreseeable future.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Weight sharing in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ensures that their
feature maps will be translation-equivariant. However, although conventional
convolutions are equivariant to translation, they are not equivariant to other
isometries of the input image data, such as rotation and reflection. For the
classification of astronomical objects such as radio galaxies, which are
expected statistically to be globally orientation invariant, this lack of
dihedral equivariance means that a conventional CNN must learn explicitly to
classify all rotated versions of a particular type of object individually. In
this work we present the first application of group-equivariant convolutional
neural networks to radio galaxy classification and explore their potential for
reducing intra-class variability by preserving equivariance for the Euclidean
group E(2), containing translations, rotations and reflections. For the radio
galaxy classification problem considered here, we find that classification
performance is modestly improved by the use of both cyclic and dihedral models
without additional hyper-parameter tuning, and that a D16 equivariant model
provides the best test performance. We use the Monte Carlo Dropout method as a
Bayesian approximation to recover epistemic uncertainty as a function of image
orientation and show that E(2)-equivariant models are able to reduce variations
in model confidence as a function of rotation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The recent boom in computational chemistry has enabled several projects aimed
at discovering useful materials or catalysts. We acknowledge and address two
recurring issues in the field of computational catalyst discovery. First,
calculating macro-scale catalyst properties is not straight-forward when using
ensembles of atomic-scale calculations (e.g., density functional theory). We
attempt to address this issue by creating a multiscale model that estimates
bulk catalyst activity using adsorption energy predictions from both density
functional theory and machine learning models. The second issue is that many
catalyst discovery efforts seek to optimize catalyst properties, but
optimization is an inherently exploitative objective that is in tension with
the explorative nature of early-stage discovery projects. In other words: why
invest so much time finding a "best" catalyst when it is likely to fail for
some other, unforeseen problem? We address this issue by relaxing the catalyst
discovery goal into a classification problem: "What is the set of catalysts
that is worth testing experimentally?" Here we present a catalyst discovery
method called myopic multiscale sampling, which combines multiscale modeling
with automated selection of density functional theory calculations. It is an
active classification strategy that seeks to classify catalysts as "worth
investigating" or "not worth investigating" experimentally. Our results show a
~7-16 times speedup in catalyst classification relative to random sampling.
These results were based on offline simulations of our algorithm on two
different datasets: a larger, synthesized dataset and a smaller, real dataset.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) is an attractive method for
accelerated quantum simulations of condensed matter due to its enhanced
computational efficiency over standard Density Functional Theory approaches.
However, DFTB models can be challenging to determine for individual systems of
interest, especially for metallic and interfacial systems where different
bonding arrangements can lead to significant changes in electronic states. In
this regard, we have created a rapid-screening approach for determining
systematically improvable DFTB interaction potentials that can yield
transferable models for a variety of conditions. Our method leverages a recent
reactive molecular dynamics force field where many-body interactions are
represented by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. This allows for
the efficient creation of multi-center representations with relative ease,
requiring only a small investment in initial DFT calculations. We have focused
our workflow on TiH$_2$ as a model system and show that a relatively small
training set based on unit-cell sized calculations yields a model accurate for
both bulk and surface properties. Our approach is easy to implement and can
yield accurate DFTB models over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions,
where physical and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly
and there is historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for
interpretation and validation of experimental results.</p>
