          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Astronomers have typically set out to solve supervised machine learning
problems by creating their own representations from scratch. We show that deep
learning models trained to answer every Galaxy Zoo DECaLS question learn
meaningful semantic representations of galaxies that are useful for new tasks
on which the models were never trained. We exploit these representations to
outperform several recent approaches at practical tasks crucial for
investigating large galaxy samples. The first task is identifying galaxies of
similar morphology to a query galaxy. Given a single galaxy assigned a free
text tag by humans (e.g. "#diffuse"), we can find galaxies matching that tag
for most tags. The second task is identifying the most interesting anomalies to
a particular researcher. Our approach is 100% accurate at identifying the most
interesting 100 anomalies (as judged by Galaxy Zoo 2 volunteers). The third
task is adapting a model to solve a new task using only a small number of
newly-labelled galaxies. Models fine-tuned from our representation are better
able to identify ring galaxies than models fine-tuned from terrestrial images
(ImageNet) or trained from scratch. We solve each task with very few new
labels; either one (for the similarity search) or several hundred (for anomaly
detection or fine-tuning). This challenges the longstanding view that deep
supervised methods require new large labelled datasets for practical use in
astronomy. To help the community benefit from our pretrained models, we release
our fine-tuning code Zoobot. Zoobot is accessible to researchers with no prior
experience in deep learning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a graph bisection and partitioning algorithm based on graph neural
networks. For each node in the graph, the network outputs probabilities for
each of the partitions. The graph neural network consists of two modules: an
embedding phase and a partitioning phase. The embedding phase is trained first
by minimizing a loss function inspired by spectral graph theory. The
partitioning module is trained through a loss function that corresponds to the
expected value of the normalized cut. Both parts of the neural network rely on
SAGE convolutional layers and graph coarsening using heavy edge matching. The
multilevel structure of the neural network is inspired by the multigrid
algorithm. Our approach generalizes very well to bigger graphs and has
partition quality comparable to METIS, Scotch and spectral partitioning, with
shorter runtime compared to METIS and spectral partitioning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Simulations of isolated giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are an important tool
for studying the dynamics of star formation, but their turbulent initial
conditions (ICs) are uncertain. Most simulations have either initialized a
velocity field with a prescribed power spectrum on a smooth density field
(failing to model the full structure of turbulence) or "stirred" turbulence
with periodic boundary conditions (which may not model real GMC boundary
conditions). We develop and test a new GMC simulation setup (called TURBSPHERE)
that combines advantages of both approaches: we continuously stir an isolated
cloud to model the energy cascade from larger scales, and use a static
potential to confine the gas. The resulting cloud and surrounding envelope
achieve a quasi-equilibrium state with the desired hallmarks of supersonic ISM
turbulence (e.g. density PDF and a $\sim k^{-2}$ velocity power spectrum),
whose bulk properties can be tuned as desired. We use the final stirred state
as initial conditions for star formation simulations with self-gravity, both
with and without continued driving and protostellar jet feedback, respectively.
We then disentangle the respective effects of the turbulent cascade, simulation
geometry, external driving, and gravity/MHD boundary conditions on the
resulting star formation. Without external driving, the new setup obtains
results similar to previous simple spherical cloud setups, but external driving
can suppress star formation considerably in the new setup. Periodic box
simulations with the same dimensions and turbulence parameters form stars
significantly slower, highlighting the importance of boundary conditions and
the presence or absence of a global collapse mode in the results of star
formation calculations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the first analysis of internal coronal mass ejection (CME)
structure observed very close to the Sun by the Wide-field Imager for Solar
PRobe (WISPR) instrument on board Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The transient
studied here is a CME observed during PSP's second perihelion passage on 2019
April 2, when PSP was only 40 R_sun from the Sun. The CME was also well
observed from 1 au by the STEREO-A spacecraft, which tracks the event all the
way from the Sun to 1 au. However, PSP/WISPR observes internal structure not
apparent in the images from 1 au. In particular, two linear features are
observed, one bright and one dark. We model these features as two loops within
the CME flux rope channel. The loops can be interpreted as bundles of field
lines, with the brightness of the bright loop indicative of lots of mass being
loaded into those field lines, and with the dark loop being devoid of such mass
loading. It is possible that these loops are actually representative of two
independent flux rope structures within the overall CME outline.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Quantifying the flux of cosmic rays reaching exoplanets around M dwarfs is
essential to understand their possible effects on exoplanet habitability. Here,
we investigate the propagation of Galactic cosmic rays as they travel through
the stellar winds (astrospheres) of five nearby M dwarfs, namely: GJ 15A, GJ
273, GJ 338B, GJ 411 and GJ 887. Our selected stars each have 1 or 2 detected
exoplanets and they all have wind mass-loss rates constrained by Lyman-alpha
observations. Our simulations use a combined 1D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
Alfv\'en-wave-driven stellar wind model and 1D cosmic ray transport model. We
find that GJ 411 and GJ 887 have Galactic cosmic rays fluxes comparable with
Earth's at their habitable zones. On the other hand, GJ 15A, GJ 273 and GJ 338B
receive a lower Galactic cosmic ray flux in their habitable zones. All
exoplanets in our sample, with exception of GJ 15A c and GJ 411 c, have a
significantly lower flux of Galactic cosmic rays than values observed at the
Earth because they orbit closer-in. The fluxes found here can be further used
for chemical modelling of planetary atmospheres. Finally, we calculate the
radiation dose at the surface of the habitable-zone planet GJ 273 b, assuming
it has an Earth-like atmosphere. This planet receives up to 209 times less 15
MeV energy cosmic ray fluxes than values observed at Earth. However, for
high-energy cosmic rays (~ GeV), the difference in flux is only 2.3 times
smaller, which contributes to GJ 273 b receiving a significant surface
radiation dose of 0.13 mSv/yr (40% of the annual dose on Earth's surface).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a systematic study of all known methyl carbon chains toward TMC-1
using the second data release of the GOTHAM survey, as well as a search for
larger species. Using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations and spectral line
stacking of over 30 rotational transitions, we report statistically significant
emission from methylcyanotriacetylene (CH$_3$C$_7$N) at a confidence level of
4.6$\sigma$, and use it to derive a column density of ${\sim}$10$^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$. We also searched for the related species, methyltetraacetylene
(CH$_3$C$_8$H), and place upper limits on the column density of this molecule.
By carrying out the above statistical analyses for all other previously
detected methyl-terminated carbon chains that have emission lines in our
survey, we assess the abundances, excitation conditions, and formation
chemistry of methylpolyynes (CH3C$_{2n}$H) and methylcyanopolyynes
(CH3C$_{2n-1}$N) in TMC-1, and compare those with predictions from a chemical
model. Based on our observed trends in column density and relative populations
of the A and E nuclear spin isomers, we find that the methylpolyynes and
methylcyanopolyynes families exhibit stark differences from one another,
pointing to separate interstellar formation pathways, which is confirmed
through gas-grain chemical modeling with nautilus.</p>
