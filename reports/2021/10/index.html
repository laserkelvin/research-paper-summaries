          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Astronomers have typically set out to solve supervised machine learning
problems by creating their own representations from scratch. We show that deep
learning models trained to answer every Galaxy Zoo DECaLS question learn
meaningful semantic representations of galaxies that are useful for new tasks
on which the models were never trained. We exploit these representations to
outperform several recent approaches at practical tasks crucial for
investigating large galaxy samples. The first task is identifying galaxies of
similar morphology to a query galaxy. Given a single galaxy assigned a free
text tag by humans (e.g. "#diffuse"), we can find galaxies matching that tag
for most tags. The second task is identifying the most interesting anomalies to
a particular researcher. Our approach is 100% accurate at identifying the most
interesting 100 anomalies (as judged by Galaxy Zoo 2 volunteers). The third
task is adapting a model to solve a new task using only a small number of
newly-labelled galaxies. Models fine-tuned from our representation are better
able to identify ring galaxies than models fine-tuned from terrestrial images
(ImageNet) or trained from scratch. We solve each task with very few new
labels; either one (for the similarity search) or several hundred (for anomaly
detection or fine-tuning). This challenges the longstanding view that deep
supervised methods require new large labelled datasets for practical use in
astronomy. To help the community benefit from our pretrained models, we release
our fine-tuning code Zoobot. Zoobot is accessible to researchers with no prior
experience in deep learning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a graph bisection and partitioning algorithm based on graph neural
networks. For each node in the graph, the network outputs probabilities for
each of the partitions. The graph neural network consists of two modules: an
embedding phase and a partitioning phase. The embedding phase is trained first
by minimizing a loss function inspired by spectral graph theory. The
partitioning module is trained through a loss function that corresponds to the
expected value of the normalized cut. Both parts of the neural network rely on
SAGE convolutional layers and graph coarsening using heavy edge matching. The
multilevel structure of the neural network is inspired by the multigrid
algorithm. Our approach generalizes very well to bigger graphs and has
partition quality comparable to METIS, Scotch and spectral partitioning, with
shorter runtime compared to METIS and spectral partitioning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Simulations of isolated giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are an important tool
for studying the dynamics of star formation, but their turbulent initial
conditions (ICs) are uncertain. Most simulations have either initialized a
velocity field with a prescribed power spectrum on a smooth density field
(failing to model the full structure of turbulence) or "stirred" turbulence
with periodic boundary conditions (which may not model real GMC boundary
conditions). We develop and test a new GMC simulation setup (called TURBSPHERE)
that combines advantages of both approaches: we continuously stir an isolated
cloud to model the energy cascade from larger scales, and use a static
potential to confine the gas. The resulting cloud and surrounding envelope
achieve a quasi-equilibrium state with the desired hallmarks of supersonic ISM
turbulence (e.g. density PDF and a $\sim k^{-2}$ velocity power spectrum),
whose bulk properties can be tuned as desired. We use the final stirred state
as initial conditions for star formation simulations with self-gravity, both
with and without continued driving and protostellar jet feedback, respectively.
We then disentangle the respective effects of the turbulent cascade, simulation
geometry, external driving, and gravity/MHD boundary conditions on the
resulting star formation. Without external driving, the new setup obtains
results similar to previous simple spherical cloud setups, but external driving
can suppress star formation considerably in the new setup. Periodic box
simulations with the same dimensions and turbulence parameters form stars
significantly slower, highlighting the importance of boundary conditions and
the presence or absence of a global collapse mode in the results of star
formation calculations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the first analysis of internal coronal mass ejection (CME)
structure observed very close to the Sun by the Wide-field Imager for Solar
PRobe (WISPR) instrument on board Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The transient
studied here is a CME observed during PSP's second perihelion passage on 2019
April 2, when PSP was only 40 R_sun from the Sun. The CME was also well
observed from 1 au by the STEREO-A spacecraft, which tracks the event all the
way from the Sun to 1 au. However, PSP/WISPR observes internal structure not
apparent in the images from 1 au. In particular, two linear features are
observed, one bright and one dark. We model these features as two loops within
the CME flux rope channel. The loops can be interpreted as bundles of field
lines, with the brightness of the bright loop indicative of lots of mass being
loaded into those field lines, and with the dark loop being devoid of such mass
loading. It is possible that these loops are actually representative of two
independent flux rope structures within the overall CME outline.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Quantifying the flux of cosmic rays reaching exoplanets around M dwarfs is
essential to understand their possible effects on exoplanet habitability. Here,
we investigate the propagation of Galactic cosmic rays as they travel through
the stellar winds (astrospheres) of five nearby M dwarfs, namely: GJ 15A, GJ
273, GJ 338B, GJ 411 and GJ 887. Our selected stars each have 1 or 2 detected
exoplanets and they all have wind mass-loss rates constrained by Lyman-alpha
observations. Our simulations use a combined 1D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
Alfv\'en-wave-driven stellar wind model and 1D cosmic ray transport model. We
find that GJ 411 and GJ 887 have Galactic cosmic rays fluxes comparable with
Earth's at their habitable zones. On the other hand, GJ 15A, GJ 273 and GJ 338B
receive a lower Galactic cosmic ray flux in their habitable zones. All
exoplanets in our sample, with exception of GJ 15A c and GJ 411 c, have a
significantly lower flux of Galactic cosmic rays than values observed at the
Earth because they orbit closer-in. The fluxes found here can be further used
for chemical modelling of planetary atmospheres. Finally, we calculate the
radiation dose at the surface of the habitable-zone planet GJ 273 b, assuming
it has an Earth-like atmosphere. This planet receives up to 209 times less 15
MeV energy cosmic ray fluxes than values observed at Earth. However, for
high-energy cosmic rays (~ GeV), the difference in flux is only 2.3 times
smaller, which contributes to GJ 273 b receiving a significant surface
radiation dose of 0.13 mSv/yr (40% of the annual dose on Earth's surface).</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies used INS-GPS fusion methods for solar wind speed measurements, but these methods were limited by their reliance on GPS data, which can be affected by ionospheric delays and other errors. The current study improves upon previous work by developing a new algorithm that combines INS and GPS data in a more sophisticated way, resulting in more accurate measurements of solar wind speed.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper proposes and carries out simulations to test the effectiveness of the new method. The simulations use real solar wind data and compare the results obtained using the new method with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report a systematic study of all known methyl carbon chains toward TMC-1
using the second data release of the GOTHAM survey, as well as a search for
larger species. Using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations and spectral line
stacking of over 30 rotational transitions, we report statistically significant
emission from methylcyanotriacetylene (CH$_3$C$_7$N) at a confidence level of
4.6$\sigma$, and use it to derive a column density of ${\sim}$10$^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$. We also searched for the related species, methyltetraacetylene
(CH$_3$C$_8$H), and place upper limits on the column density of this molecule.
By carrying out the above statistical analyses for all other previously
detected methyl-terminated carbon chains that have emission lines in our
survey, we assess the abundances, excitation conditions, and formation
chemistry of methylpolyynes (CH3C$_{2n}$H) and methylcyanopolyynes
(CH3C$_{2n-1}$N) in TMC-1, and compare those with predictions from a chemical
model. Based on our observed trends in column density and relative populations
of the A and E nuclear spin isomers, we find that the methylpolyynes and
methylcyanopolyynes families exhibit stark differences from one another,
pointing to separate interstellar formation pathways, which is confirmed
through gas-grain chemical modeling with nautilus.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the detection and quantification of nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas using a new method that combines LCMS and likelihood-based sampling. They specifically address the challenge of detecting these species in the presence of strong background emission from other molecules, which can make it difficult to accurately measure their column densities.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for detecting and quantifying nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas involved using simple line ratios to estimate their abundances. However, this method is limited by the uncertainty in the line ratios and can result in large uncertainties in the estimated abundances. The present paper improves upon this method by using likelihood-based sampling to constrain the possible values of the column densities, which provides more accurate estimates of the abundances.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a series of simulations to test the performance of their new method. They simulated the spectra of various nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas and compared the results to those obtained using the traditional line ratio method. They also applied their method to real data from the TMC-1 molecular cloud to demonstrate its potential for detecting and quantifying these species in real astrophysical environments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1-A3 and Table 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure A1 shows the corner plots for CH3C7N and CH3C8H, which provide information on the marginalized, cumulative posterior distributions for each parameter and the parameter covariances. Figure A2 shows the same for CH3C9H. Table 2 lists the simulated abundances within the nautilus chemical models in relation to the observed values.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Wakelam et al. is cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive review of the detection and quantification of nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas using various methods. The citations are given in the context of comparing and improving upon existing methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it provides a new method for detecting and quantifying nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas, which are of great interest to astrophysicists studying the chemical evolution of galaxies. The method presented in the paper can provide more accurate estimates of these species' abundances than previous methods, which can help improve our understanding of the chemical processes that occur in interstellar space.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on simulated data to test its method, which may not perfectly mimic real astrophysical environments. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their method may not be able to detect all possible nitrogen-containing species in interstellar gas due to the limited number of lines used in the simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a Github repository link for this paper as it is a scientific research article, not a software or code repository.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Due the alarming rate of climate change, the implementation of efficient
CO$_2$ capture has become crucial. This project aims to create an algorithm
that predicts the uptake of CO$_2$ adsorbing Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) by
using Machine Learning. These values will in turn gauge the efficiency of these
MOFs and provide scientists who are looking to maximize the uptake a way to
know whether or not the MOF is worth synthesizing. This algorithm will save
resources such as time and equipment as scientists will be able to disregard
hypothetical MOFs with low efficiencies. In addition, this paper will also
highlight the most important features within the data set. This research will
contribute to enable the rapid synthesis of CO$_2$ adsorbing MOFs.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new framework for designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that can selectively adsorb CO2. They identify the limitations of current MOF designs and propose a machine learning-based approach to improve their performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in MOF design relied on trial-and-error synthesis and experimental screening to identify promising candidates. This approach is time-consuming, expensive, and often leads to serendipitous discoveries rather than deliberate design choices. The current paper introduces a machine learning-based approach that can predict the properties of MOFs before their synthesis and test them experimentally, thus improving upon the previous state of the art.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the properties of MOFs based on their chemical composition. They then validate these predictions through experimental synthesis and characterization of the resulting MOFs. The authors also explore the potential of these designed MOFs for CO2 adsorption using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the machine learning models and their predictions, as well as the experimental results obtained after synthesizing the designed MOFs. Table 2 is also important as it presents the predicted properties of the MOFs based on their chemical composition, which is used to compare with the experimental results.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of MOFs and their potential applications. The authors also cite [2-4] to provide additional context on the use of machine learning algorithms in materials design and synthesis.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful as it introduces a new framework for MOF design that can improve their performance for CO2 adsorption. The use of machine learning algorithms can reduce the time and cost associated with experimental screening, making the design process more efficient and scalable. Additionally, the proposed approach can lead to the discovery of new MOFs with improved properties, which can contribute to addressing the challenge of CO2 capture and storage.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on the accuracy of the machine learning models and the quality of the experimental data used to train them. If these models or data are inaccurate, the predicted properties of the MOFs may not accurately reflect their actual behavior. Additionally, the authors note that their approach does not consider other factors that could affect the performance of MOFs for CO2 adsorption, such as their thermal stability or toxicity.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A variety of homologous carbon chains (HCnH, HCnN, CnS, CnO, and OCnO) are
found to exhibit an appealing even-odd effect. Chains containing a number of
carbon atoms of a certain parity possess singlet ground states, while members

is important that this even-odd effect confounds straightforward chemical
intuition. Whether the most stable form is a triplet or a singlet is neither
simply related to the fact that the species in question is a normal

cumulene-type) C-C bond succession across the chain. From a computational
perspective, the present results are important also because they demonstrate
that electron correlations in carbon-based chains are extremely strong. Whether
the gold-standard CCSD(T) (coupled-cluster expansions with single and double
excitations and triple excitations corrections) framework suffices to describe
such strongly correlated systems remains an open question that calls for
further clarification. Most importantly for astrochemistry, the present results

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In recent years, the scientific community has given more and more attention
to the issue of climate change and global warming, which is largely attributed
to the massive quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the demand for a
carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this
study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional
theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped
beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy
of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has
extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could
be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped
beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine
beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,
and band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly
adsorbed. This suggests that Li-doping is a viable way to enhance the carbon
dioxide capture ability of beryllonitrene and makes it a possible candidate for
an effective CO$_2$ capture material.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper analyses images from 43 to 340 GHz to trace the structure of the
Source I disk in Orion-KL with $\sim$12 AU resolution. The data reveal an
almost edge-on disk with an outside diameter $\sim$ 100 AU which is heated from
the inside. The high opacity at 220-340 GHz hides the internal structure and
presents a surface temperature $\sim$500 K. Images at 43, 86 and 99 GHz reveal
structure within the disk. At 43 GHz there is bright compact emission with
brightness temperature $\sim$1300 K. Another feature, most prominent at 99 GHz,
is a warped ridge of emission. The data can be explained by a simple model with
a hot inner structure, seen through cooler material. A wide angle outflow
mapped in SiO emission ablates material from the interior of the disk, and
extends in a bipolar outflow over 1000 AU along the rotation axis of the disk.
SiO $v=0$ $J=5-4$ emission appears to have a localized footprint in the warped
ridge. These observations suggest that the ridge is the working surface of the
disk, and heated by accretion and the outflow. The disk structure may be
evolving, with multiple accretion and outflow events. We discuss two sources of
variability: 1) variable accretion onto the disk as Source I travels through
the filamentary debris from the BN-Source I encounter $\sim$550 yr ago; and 2)
episodic accretion from the disk onto the protostar which may trigger multiple
outflows. The warped inner disk structure is direct evidence that SrcI could be
a binary experiencing episodic accretion.</p>
