          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Chemistry along the star- and planet-formation sequence regulates how
prebiotic building blocks -- carriers of the elements CHNOPS -- are
incorporated into nascent planetesimals and planets. Spectral line observations
across the electromagnetic spectrum are needed to fully characterize
interstellar CHNOPS chemistry, yet to date there are only limited astrochemical
constraints at THz frequencies. Here, we highlight advances to the study of
CHNOPS astrochemistry that will be possible with the Orbiting Astronomical
Satellite for Investigating Stellar Systems (OASIS). OASIS is a NASA mission
concept for a space-based observatory that will utilize an inflatable 14-m
reflector along with a heterodyne receiver system to observe at THz frequencies
with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. As part of a survey of
H2O and HD towards ~100 protostellar and protoplanetary disk systems, OASIS
will also obtain statistical constraints on the inventories of light hydrides
including NH3 and H2S towards protoplanetary disks, as well as complex organics
in protostellar hot corinos and envelopes. Line surveys of additional
star-forming regions, including high-mass hot cores, protostellar outflow
shocks, and prestellar cores, will also leverage the unique capabilities of
OASIS to probe high-excitation organics and small hydrides, as is needed to
fully understand the chemistry of these objects.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new algorithm for detecting exoplanets in observational data, specifically targeting those with low-mass host stars and small orbital separations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in exoplanet detection algorithms focused on machine learning techniques that relied on hand-crafted features and were computationally expensive. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on a hybrid approach that combines wavelet analysis and Gaussian process regression, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate detections with fewer computational resources.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors simulated a dataset of exoplanet transit observations using a variety of low-mass host stars and small orbital separations, and tested their algorithm on these simulations. They also performed a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their algorithm under different conditions, such as varying the number of observations and the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 2 and 3, and Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 2 shows the performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the previous state of the art, while Figure 3 provides a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance for different types of low-mass host stars. Table 1 presents the results of the simulations used to test the algorithm's performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is [2], which is mentioned throughout the paper as a previous work that proposed an algorithm for exoplanet detection. The authors also cite [3] and [4] for their contributions to the field of exoplanet detection and machine learning, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a new algorithm for detecting exoplanets that is more accurate and efficient than previous methods. This could lead to a significant improvement in the detection of exoplanets, particularly those with low-mass host stars and small orbital separations, which are difficult to detect using current methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their algorithm is based on a simplifying assumption that the signal-to-noise ratio is constant across all observations, which may not be accurate in practice. They also mention that further testing and validation are needed to confirm the performance of their algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github repository is provided in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
A: #exoplanets #exoplanetdetection #machinelearning #Gaussianprocesses #waveletanalysis #observationaldata #lowmassstars #smallorbitalseparations #accuracy #efficiency</p>
