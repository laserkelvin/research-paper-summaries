          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Formamide (NH$_2$CHO) has been identified as a potential precursor of a wide
variety of organic compounds essential to life, and many biochemical studies
propose it likely played a crucial role in the context of the origin of life on
our planet. The detection of formamide in comets, which are believed to have
--at least partially-- inherited their current chemical composition during the
birth of the Solar System, raises the question whether a non-negligible amount
of formamide may have been exogenously delivered onto a very young Earth about
four billion years ago. A crucial part of the effort to answer this question
involves searching for formamide in regions where stars and planets are forming
today in our Galaxy, as this can shed light on its formation, survival, and
chemical re-processing along the different evolutionary phases leading to a
star and planetary system like our own. The present review primarily addresses
the chemistry of formamide in the interstellar medium, from the point of view
of (i) astronomical observations, (ii) experiments, and (iii) theoretical
calculations. While focusing on just one molecule, this review also more
generally reflects the importance of joining efforts across multiple scientific
disciplines in order to make progress in the highly interdisciplinary science
of astrochemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Methanol is a key species in astrochemistry since it is the most abundant
organic molecule in the ISM and is thought to be the mother molecule of many
complex organic species. Estimating the deuteration of methanol around young
protostars is of crucial importance because it highly depends on its formation
mechanisms and the physical conditions during its moment of formation. We
analyse dozens of transitions from deuterated methanol isotopologues coming
from various existing observational datasets from the IRAM-PdBI and ALMA sub-mm
interferometers to estimate the methanol deuteration surrounding three low-mass
protostars on Solar System scales. A population diagram analysis allows us to
derive a [CH$_2$DOH]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratio of 3-6 % and a
[CH$_3$OD]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of 0.4-1.6 % in the warm inner protostellar
regions. These values are ten times lower than those derived with previous
single-dish observations towards these sources but they are 10-100 times higher
than the methanol deuteration measured in massive hot cores. Dust temperature
maps obtained from Herschel and Planck observations show that massive hot cores
are located in warmer molecular clouds than low-mass sources, with temperature
differences of $\sim$10 K. Comparison with the predictions of the gas-grain
astrochemical model GRAINOBLE shows that such a temperature difference is
sufficient to explain the different deuteration observed in low- to high-mass
sources, suggesting that the physical conditions of the molecular cloud at the
origin of the protostars mostly govern the present observed deuteration of
methanol. The methanol deuteration measured in this work is higher by a factor
of 5 than the upper limit in methanol deuteration estimated in comet Hale-Bopp,
implying that an important reprocessing of the organic material would have
occurred in the solar nebula during the formation of the Solar System.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the deuterium fractionations of CH2DOH, CH3OD, HDO, and CH2DCN in hot cores of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and high-mass protostars using sub-mm interferometers, and to investigate how these deuteration levels vary with dust temperature in the surrounding cloud.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous studies have shown that deuterium fractionations in hot cores can be high, but there is still a lack of understanding about the dependence of these fractions on the dust temperature of the surrounding cloud. This study improves upon previous work by using a more detailed astrochemical model and a larger sample size to investigate the dependence of deuteration levels on dust temperature in different protostar types.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors analyzed data from sub-mm interferometers to observe the deuterium fractionations of CH2DOH, CH3OD, HDO, and CH2DCN towards hot cores of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and high-mass protostars. They also calculated the deuteration levels predicted by a detailed astrochemical model as a function of dust temperature in the surrounding cloud.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed deuterium fractionations of CH2DOH, CH3OD, HDO, and CH2DCN towards hot cores of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and high-mass protostars. Table 1 lists the sample of protostars used in the study, while Table 2 provides the deuteration levels predicted by the astrochemical model at different dust temperatures. Table 3 lists the observed and calculated deuterium fractionations for each molecule.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references related to the astrochemical model used in the study, including works by Tielens and McKee (2005), Wakelam et al. (2012), and Muller et al. (2014). These citations are given to provide a better understanding of the model and its assumptions, as well as to place the results of the study within the context of existing knowledge on astrochemistry.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors suggest that their study could have implications for our understanding of the chemistry and physics of hot cores in different protostar types, as well as for the formation of organic molecules in space. By showing how deuterium fractionations vary with dust temperature in the surrounding cloud, the authors provide new insights into the role of the environment on the chemical composition of hot cores.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their sample size is limited to three protostar types, which may not be representative of all protostars. They also note that their model assumes a fixed dust temperature in the surrounding cloud, which may not be accurate for all hot cores. Additionally, they caution that the deuterium fractionations observed towards hot cores could be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of magnetic fields or shocks, which were not taken into account in their study.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I couldn't find a Github repository link associated with this paper.</p>
