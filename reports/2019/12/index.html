          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>For astronomers to make a significant contribution to the reduction of
climate change-inducing greenhouse gas emissions, we first must quantify our
sources of emissions and review the most effective approaches for reducing
them. Here we estimate that Australian astronomers' total greenhouse gas
emissions from their regular work activities are $\gtrsim$25 ktCO$_2$-e/yr
(equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This can be broken into
$\sim$15 ktCO$_2$-e/yr from supercomputer usage, $\sim$4.2 ktCO$_2$-e/yr from
flights (where individuals' flight emissions correlate with seniority), $>$3.3
ktCO$_2$-e/yr from the operation of observatories, and 2.6$\pm$0.4
ktCO$_2$-e/yr from powering office buildings. Split across faculty scientists,
postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students, this averages to $\gtrsim$37
tCO$_2$-e/yr per astronomer, over 40% more than what the average Australian
non-dependant emits in total, equivalent to $\sim$5$\times$ the global average.
To combat these environmentally unsustainable practices, we suggest astronomers
should strongly preference use of supercomputers, observatories, and office
spaces that are predominantly powered by renewable energy sources. Where
facilities that we currently use do not meet this requirement, their funders
should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as solar or wind farms. Air
travel should also be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video
conferencing, which should also promote inclusivity.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to assess the incremental cost of renewable generation in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and evaluate the feasibility of achieving 100% renewable electricity systems.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous studies that focused on the cost of renewable energy sources, but did not consider the entire electricity market. This study provides a more comprehensive assessment of the incremental cost of renewable generation in the NEM.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of data analysis and modeling to estimate the incremental cost of renewable generation in the NEM. They analyzed historical data on electricity prices and renewable energy output, and developed a simulation model to estimate the future costs of renewable energy.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the estimated incremental cost of renewable generation in the NEM. Table 1 is also important, as it lists the renewable energy sources included in the study and their corresponding capacities.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [42] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the feasibility of 100% renewable electricity systems. The authors also cite [43] to provide context on diversity and inclusion in astronomy.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could contribute to the development of a more sustainable electricity market by providing a detailed assessment of the incremental cost of renewable generation in the NEM. This information could be used to inform policy decisions and investments in renewable energy infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their analysis assumes a fixed grid connection fee for renewable energy sources, which may not be accurate in all cases. They also note that their estimate of the incremental cost of renewable generation may underestimate the true cost due to the complexity of the electricity market and the lack of data on renewable energy prices.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
A: #renewableenergy #australianelectricitymarket #feasibilitystudy #sustainability #policyanalysis #gridconnectionfee #electricityprices #modeling #simulation #dataanalysis</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Data science and informatics tools have been proliferating recently within
the computational materials science and catalysis fields. This proliferation
has spurned the creation of various frameworks for automated materials
screening, discovery, and design. Underpinning these frameworks are surrogate
models with uncertainty estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty
estimates are instrumental for determining which materials to screen next, but
the computational catalysis field does not yet have a standard procedure for
judging the quality of such uncertainty estimates. Here we present a suite of
figures and performance metrics derived from the machine learning community
that can be used to judge the quality of such uncertainty estimates. This suite
probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We
then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting
density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies. Of the methods
studied here, we find that the best performer is a model where a convolutional
neural network is used to supply features to a Gaussian process regressor,
which then makes predictions of adsorption energies along with corresponding
uncertainty estimates.</p>
