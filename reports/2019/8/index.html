          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We analyze high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of three nearby exoplanet host
stars (HD 192310, HD 9826, and HD 206860) to study interstellar properties
along their lines of sight and to search for the presence of astrospheric
absorption. Using HST/STIS spectra of the Lyman-alpha, Mg II, and Fe II lines,
we identify three interstellar velocity components in the lines of sight to
each star. We can reliably assign eight of the nine components to partially
ionized clouds found by Redfield & Linsky (2008) on the basis of the star's
location in Galactic coordinates and agreement of measured radial velocities
with velocities predicted from the cloud velocity vectors. None of the stars
show blue-shifted absorption indicative of an astrosphere, implying that the
stars are in regions of ionized interstellar gas. Coupling astrospheric and
local interstellar medium measurements is necessary to evaluate the host star
electromagnetic and particle flux, which have profound impacts on the
atmospheres of their orbiting planets. We present a table of all known
exoplanets located within 20 pc of the Sun listing their interstellar
properties and velocities predicted from the local cloud velocity vectors.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of interstellar medium (ISM) observations and models, with a focus on the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). They seek to improve our understanding of the LIC's structure, composition, and dynamics, and their impact on the surrounding ISM.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors build upon previous works by providing a more detailed analysis of the LIC's properties, including its column density, temperature, and velocity structure. They also incorporate new observational data and models to provide a more accurate representation of the ISM.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the available observational data and models related to the LIC. They analyzed the column densities, temperatures, and velocities of the ISM in the line of sight to the stars listed in the table.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several figures and tables throughout the paper, but the most frequent references are Figs. 1, 2, and 3, which show the column density maps of the LIC and its surroundings. Table 1 is also frequently referenced, as it provides a summary of the predicted velocities for the listed stars.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references related to the ISM and its observations, including Redfield & Linsky (2008) and Wood et al. (2014a). These references are cited throughout the paper to provide additional context and support for the authors' findings.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their work provides a more accurate representation of the LIC's structure and dynamics, which can help improve our understanding of the ISM and its impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. This could have implications for future studies of the ISM and the evolution of the galaxy as a whole.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their work is based on a limited sample of stars, which may not be representative of the entire LIC. They also note that their models are simplifications of the complex dynamics of the ISM, and that future studies could improve upon these models.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
