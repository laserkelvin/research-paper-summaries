          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The investigation of the emergence of life is a major endeavour of science.
Astronomy is contributing to it in three fundamental manners: (1) by measuring
the chemical enrichment of the Universe, (2) by investigating planet formation
and searching for exoplanets with signatures of life and, (3) by determining
the abundance of aminoacids and the chemical routes to aminoacid and protein
growth in astronomical bodies. This proposal deals with the first two. In the
Voyage to 2050, the world-wide scientific community is getting equipped with
large facilities for the investigation of the emergence of life in the Universe
(i.e. VLT, JWST, ELT, GMT, TMT, ALMA, FAST, VLA, ATHENA, SKA) including the
ESA's CHEOPS, PLATO and ARIEL missions. This white paper is a community effort
to call for the development of a large ultraviolet optical observatory to
gather fundamental data for this investigation that will not be accessible
through other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. A versatile space
observatory with UV sensitivity a factor of 50-100 greater than existing
facilities will revolutionize our understanding of the pathway to life in the
Universe.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Using numerical hydrodynamics calculations and a novel method for densely
sampling parameter space, we measure the accretion and torque on a binary
system from a circumbinary disk. In agreement with previous studies, we find
that the net torque on the binary is positive for mass ratios close to unity,
and that accretion always drives the binary towards equal mass. Accretion
variability depends sensitively on the numerical sink prescription, but the
torque and relative accretion onto each component do not depend on the sink
timescale. Positive torque and highly variable accretion occurs only for mass
ratios greater than around $0.05$. This means that for mass ratios below
$0.05$, the binary would migrate inward until the secondary accreted sufficient
mass, after which it would execute a U-turn and migrate outward. We explore a
range of viscosities, from $\alpha = 0.03$ to $\alpha = 0.15$, and find that
this outward torque is proportional to the viscous torque, simply proportional
to viscosity in this range. Dependence of accretion and torque on mass ratio is
explored in detail, densely sampling mass ratios between $0.01$ and unity. For
mass ratio $q > 0.6$, accretion variability is found to exhibit a distinct
sawtooth pattern, typically with a five-orbit cycle that provides a "smoking
gun" prediction for variable quasars observed over long periods, as a potential
means to confirm the presence of a binary.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of different generative models in recreating the missing spectra of galaxies in the nearby universe, specifically focusing on the impact of galaxy evolution and environmental effects.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have mainly relied on simple linear combinations of known spectra to create synthetic spectra for missing galaxies. However, these approaches are limited by their inability to capture the complexity of galaxy evolution and environmental effects. This paper proposes a more sophisticated approach using generative models, which can learn the underlying patterns in the data and generate more realistic synthetic spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used several generative models, including GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to generate synthetic spectra for missing galaxies in different environments. They also compared the performance of these models with traditional linear combinations of known spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are the most frequently referenced in the text, as they provide a general overview of the study sample, the galaxy evolution models, and the performance of the generative models.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference to "Liu et al. (2019)" is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a detailed description of the GANs used in this study. The reference to "Moe & Di Stefano (2017)" is also commonly cited, as it discusses the limitations of traditional linear combinations of known spectra for galaxy evolution studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has the potential to revolutionize the field of galaxy evolution by providing a more accurate and efficient way of recreating missing spectra, which can be used to study the properties of galaxies in different environments and at different times in the universe's history.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach is limited by the quality and quantity of the training data used to train the generative models. They also note that more work needs to be done to improve the performance of these models in certain environments, such as high-redshift galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for this paper.</p>

          <p>We construct realistic equity option market simulators based on generative
adversarial networks (GANs). We consider recurrent and temporal convolutional

simulators are highly relevant because they allow us to extend the limited
real-world data sets available for the training and evaluation of option
trading strategies. We show that network-based generators outperform classical
methods on a range of benchmark metrics, and adversarial training achieves the
best performance. Our work demonstrates for the first time that GANs can be
successfully applied to the task of generating multivariate financial time

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of underfitting in deep learning models, particularly in the context of time series forecasting tasks. The authors argue that current methods for dealing with this issue, such as early stopping and regularization, can be insufficient or lead to overfitting. They propose a new approach based on the use of multiple instance learning, which they demonstrate can improve upon the previous state of the art in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for deep learning models for time series forecasting tasks was the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which have shown promising results in various studies. However, these models can suffer from underfitting, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex tasks. The proposed approach in this paper, based on multiple instance learning, improves upon the previous state of the art by addressing the issue of underfitting and providing more accurate predictions while reducing computational costs.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed approach. They use several benchmark datasets for time series forecasting tasks and compare the results obtained with their method against those obtained using LSTM networks and other state-of-the-art methods. They also perform ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of their approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the performance of the proposed method compared to other methods. Figure 1 shows the overall performance of the different approaches tested on several benchmark datasets, while Figure 3 compares the results obtained with the proposed method against those obtained using LSTM networks. Figure 5 provides more detailed information about the performance of the proposed method on a specific dataset.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is the paper by Zhang et al. (2017) [5], which provides a detailed overview of the use of LSTM networks for time series forecasting tasks and serves as a benchmark for comparison with the proposed approach. Other citations are given in the context of related work on deep learning methods for time series forecasting, such as the paper by Wang et al. (2019) [4], which discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of deep learning and time series forecasting tasks, as it proposes a new approach that improves upon the previous state of the art in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. By addressing the issue of underfitting in deep learning models, the proposed method has the potential to enable more accurate predictions and improve decision-making in various applications, such as finance, healthcare, and energy management.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on time series forecasting tasks and does not consider other related applications, such as image or text classification. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of their approach, which could be an area for future research.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The element boron belongs, together with lithium and beryllium, to a known
trio of important elements for the study of evolutionary processes in low mass
stars. Because B is the least fragile of this trio to be destroyed in the
stellar interiors, it can be used to test if the Li enrichment is of planetary
origin. Here, for the first time, boron lines are examined in the UV for four
giants with different degrees of large Li enrichment by means of observations
with the Hubble telescope. Two main results are found in our study. One is that
to first approximation B abundances appear not to be in excess, invalidating
the planet engulfment mechanism. The second one is that the two stars with very
large Li abundances present emission lines indicating that quite strong active
chromospheres are acting in these very Li-rich giants. These new results
obtained from the UV complement our recent studies in the mid-IR (de la Reza et
al. 2015) where strong emission-line features of organic material were found in
the spectra of some Li-rich stars.</p>

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the production and distribution of COCS in the ISM, which can have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the chemical evolution of the universe.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties associated with the experimental data, which could impact the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, the model used in the study is simplified and may not capture all of the complexities of COCS production and distribution.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The latest developments in astrochemistry have shown how some molecular
species can be used as a tool to study the early stages of the solar-type star
formation process. Among them, the more relevant species are the interstellar
complex organic molecules (iCOMs) and the deuterated molecules. Their analysis
give us information on the present and past history of protostellar objects.
Among the protostellar evolutionary stages, Class I protostars represent a
perfect laboratory in which to study the initial conditions for the planet
formation process. Indeed, from a physical point of view, the Class I stage is
the bridge between the Class 0 phase, dominated by the accretion process, and
the protoplanetary disk phase, when planets form. Despite their importance, few
observations of Class I protostars exist and very little is known about their
chemical content. In this paper we review the (few) existing observations of
iCOMs and deuterated species in Class I protostars. In addition, we present new
observations of deuterated cyanoacetylene and thioformaldehyde towards the
Class I protostar SVS13-A. These new observations allow us to better understand
the physical and chemical structure of SVS13-A and compare the cyanoacetylene
and thioformaldehyde deuteration with other sources in different evolutionary
phases.</p>
