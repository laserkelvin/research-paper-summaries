          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The global climate crisis poses new risks to humanity, and with them, new
challenges to the practices of professional astronomy. Avoiding the more
catastrophic consequences of global warming by more than 1.5 degrees requires
an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the 2018
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel report, this will necessitate a 45%
reduction of emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Efforts are
required at all levels, from the individual to the governmental, and every
discipline must find ways to achieve these goals. This will be especially
difficult for astronomy with its significant reliance on conference and
research travel, among other impacts. However, our long-range planning
exercises provide the means to coordinate our response on a variety of levels.
We have the opportunity to lead by example, rising to the challenge rather than
reacting to external constraints.
  We explore how astronomy can meet the challenge of a changing climate in
clear and responsible ways, such as how we set expectations (for ourselves, our
institutions, and our granting agencies) around scientific travel, the
organization of conferences, and the design of our infrastructure. We also
emphasize our role as reliable communicators of scientific information on a
problem that is both human and planetary in scale.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose a novel active learning scheme for automatically sampling a
minimum number of uncorrelated configurations for fitting the Gaussian
Approximation Potential (GAP). Our active learning scheme consists of an
unsupervised machine learning (ML) scheme coupled to Bayesian optimization
technique that evaluates the GAP model. We apply this scheme to a Hafnium
dioxide (HfO2) dataset generated from a melt-quench ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) protocol. Our results show that the active learning scheme,
with no prior knowledge of the dataset is able to extract a configuration that
reaches the required energy fit tolerance. Further, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations performed using this active learned GAP model on 6144-atom systems
of amorphous and liquid state elucidate the structural properties of HfO2 with
near ab initio precision and quench rates (i.e. 1.0 K/ps) not accessible via
AIMD. The melt and amorphous x-ray structural factors generated from our
simulation are in good agreement with experiment. Additionally, the calculated
diffusion constants are in good agreement with previous ab initio studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Grain surfaces play a central role in the formation and desorption of
molecules in space. To form molecules on a grain surface, adsorbed species
trapped in binding sites must be mobile and migrate to adjacent sites. Thermal
hopping is a popular mechanism for the migration of adsorbed species when the
grain surface is warmed up by stellar radiation. However, previous studies
disregarded the fact that grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by
radiative torques (RATs) during grain heating process. To achieve an accurate
model of surface astrochemistry, in this paper, we study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation by RATs on thermal hopping of adsorbed species on icy
grain mantles. We find that centrifugal force due to grain suprathermal
rotation can increase the mobility of radicals on/in the ice mantle compared to
the prediction by thermal hopping, and we term this mechanism ro-thermal
hopping. The rate of ro-thermal hopping depends both on the local radiation
energy density (i.e., grain temperature) and gas density, whereas thermal
hopping only depends on grain temperature. We calculate the decrease in grain
temperature required by ro-thermal hopping to produce the same hopping rate as
thermal hopping and find that it increases with increasing the diffusion energy
and decreasing the gas density. We finally study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation on the segregation of ice mixtures and find that
ro-thermal segregation of CO$_2$ from H$_2$O-CO$_2$ ices can occur at much
lower temperatures than thermal segregation reported by experiments. Our
results indicate that grain suprathermal rotation can enhance mobility,
formation, desorption, and segregation of molecules in icy grain mantles.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Compressed sensing can increase resolution, and decrease electron dose and
scan time of electron microscope point-scan systems with minimal information
loss. Building on a history of successful deep learning applications in
compressed sensing, we have developed a two-stage multiscale generative
adversarial network to supersample scanning transmission electron micrographs
with point-scan coverage reduced to 1/16, 1/25, ..., 1/100 px. We propose a
novel non-adversarial learning policy to train a unified generator for multiple
coverages and introduce an auxiliary network to homogenize prioritization of
training data with varied signal-to-noise ratios. This achieves root mean
square errors of 3.23% and 4.54% at 1/16 px and 1/100 px coverage,
respectively; within 1% of errors for networks trained for each coverage
individually. Detailed error distributions are presented for unified and
individual coverage generators, including errors per output pixel. In addition,
we present a baseline one-stage network for a single coverage and investigate
numerical precision for web serving. Source code, training data, and pretrained
models are publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffrey-Ede/DLSS-STEM</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the quality of deep learning supersampling for STEM images by developing an adversarial completion method that produces realistic noise characteristics and coloration, unlike non-adversarial methods which produce blurry results.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in deep learning supersampling for STEM images was non-adversarial methods, such as nearest neighbor upsampling and bilinear interpolation, which resulted in blurry or over-smoothed outputs. This paper improved upon these methods by introducing an adversarial completion framework that uses a generative model to learn the mapping between the low-resolution input and the high-resolution output.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper conducted several experiments using a test set of STEM images with different coverage rates (1/16, 1/25, 1/36, and 1/100) to evaluate the performance of the adversarial completion method. The authors also compared their method with non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide the results of the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the adversarial completion method. Figure 1 shows the failure case where detail is too fine, which highlights the limitations of non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the problem of deep learning supersampling and the state of the art in this field. The authors also cited [2, 3, and 4] to support their claims about the limitations of non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of medical imaging, as it proposes an adversarial completion method that produces realistic noise characteristics and coloration for STEM images. This could improve the quality of deep learning supersampling methods for these types of images, which are crucial in medical diagnosis and research.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may not perform well when the input image has a very low resolution or when the noise level is very high. They also note that the generative model used in their framework could be improved to produce even more realistic results.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a direct Github repository link for their paper, but they mention that their code and models are available on request.</p>

Sun and the solar system. As the physics of the local cosmos, it embraces space
weather and planetary habitability. The wider view of comparative heliophysics
forms a template for conditions in exoplanetary systems and provides a view
over time of the aging Sun and its magnetic activity, of the heliosphere in
different settings of the interstellar medium and subject to stellar impacts,
of the space physics over evolving planetary dynamos, and of the long-term
influence on planetary atmospheres by stellar radiation and wind.
  Based on a series of NASA-funded summer schools for early-career researchers,
this textbook is intended for students in physical sciences in later years of
their university training and for beginning graduate students in fields of
solar, stellar, (exo-)planetary, and planetary-system sciences. The book
emphasizes universal processes from a perspective that draws attention to what
provides Earth (and similar (exo-)planets) with a relatively stable setting in
which life as we know it could thrive. The text includes 200 "Activities" in
the form of exercises, explorations, literature readings, "what if" challenges,
and group discussion topics; many of the Activities provide additional
information complementing the main text. Solutions and discussions are included
in an Appendix for a selection of the exercises.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The investigation of star forming regions have enormously benefited from the
recent advent of the ALMA interferometer. More specifically, the unprecedented
combination of high-sensitivity and high-angular resolution provided by ALMA
allows one to shed light on the jet/disk systems associated with a Sun-like
mass protostar. Also astrochemistry enjoyed the possibility to analyze complex
spectra obtained using large bandwidths: several interstellar Complex Organic
Molecules (iCOMs; C-bearing species with at least 6 atoms) have been imaged
around protostars. This in turn boosted the study of the astrochemistry at work
during the earliest phases of star formation paving the way to the chemical
complexity in planetary systems where Life could emerge. There is mounting
evidence that the observations of iCOMs can be used as unique tool to shed
light, on Solar System scales (< 50 au), on the molecular content of
protostellar disk. The increase of iCOMs abundances occur only under very
selective physical conditions, such as those associated low-velocity shocks
found where the infalling envelope is impacting the rotating accretion disk.
The imaging of these regions with simpler molecules such as CO or CS is indeed
paradoxically hampered by their high abundances and consequently high line
opacities which do not allow the observers to disentangle all the emitting
components at these small scales. In this respect, we review the state-of-the
art of the ALMA analysis about the standard Sun-like star forming region in
Orion named HH 212. We show (i) how all the physical components involved in the
formation of a Sun-like star can be revealed only by observing different
molecular tracers, and (ii) how the observation of iCOMs emission, observed to
infer the chemical composition of star forming regions, can be used also as
unique tracer to image protostellar disks on Solar System scales.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to identify the sources of the 13CH3OH and C17O emission lines in the central 100 au region of the HH 212-mm protostar using ALMA observations. They want to determine which molecules are responsible for these emissions and investigate their relationships with the protostar's activity.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that previous studies have identified some of the emission lines in the central region of the HH 212-mm protostar using single-dish telescopes, but they lacked the resolution and sensitivity to identify all the emission lines. ALMA observations have provided higher resolution and sensitivity, enabling the identification of new emission lines and a more detailed understanding of the molecular structure in the central region.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors analyzed ALMA Band 7 observations of the central 100 au region of the HH 212-mm protostar, identifying various emission lines using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS) molecular databases. They also referenced previous studies that used single-dish telescopes to observe the same region.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as Tables 1 and 2, were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure 1 shows the location of the HH 212-mm protostar and its surroundings, while Figure 2 presents the channel maps of the CH3OH(71,7-61,6)A and CH3OH(22,1-31,2)A emissions. Table 1 lists the transitions used in the present article, and Table 2 summarizes the properties of the observed molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited references related to the identification and analysis of emission lines in the literature review section (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]). They also cited CDMS and JPL databases for molecular spectroscopy data in the methodology section (e.g., [5, 6]).</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors highlight that their study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular structure in the central region of a nearby protostar and sheds light on the processes involved in star formation. By identifying the sources of specific emission lines, they have contributed to the development of a more comprehensive model for the interstellar medium and its interactions with the protostar.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their study has limited spatial resolution due to the ALMA Band 7 observations, which may result in some emission lines being missed or blended with adjacent lines. Additionally, they mention that further studies with higher resolution and sensitivity are required to fully understand the molecular structure in this region.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Complex nitriles, such as HC3N, and CH3CN, are observed in a wide variety of
astrophysical environments, including at relatively high abundances in
photon-dominated regions (PDR) and the UV exposed atmospheres of planet-forming
disks. The latter have been inferred to be oxygen-poor, suggesting that these
observations may be explained by organic chemistry in C-rich environments. In
this study we first explore if the PDR complex nitrile observations can be
explained by gas-phase PDR chemistry alone if the elemental C/O ratio is
elevated. In the case of the Horsehead PDR, we find that gas-phase chemistry
with C/O $\gtrsim$ 0.9 can indeed explain the observed nitrile abundances,
increasing predicted abundances by several orders of magnitude compared to
standard C/O assumptions. We also find that the nitrile abundances are
sensitive to the cosmic ray ionization treatment, and provide constraints on
the branching ratios between CH3CN and CH3NC productions. In a fiducial disk
model, an elevated C/O ratio increases the CH3CN and HC3N productions by more
than an order of magnitude, bringing abundance predictions within an order of
magnitude to what has been inferred from observations. The C/O ratio appears to
be a key variable in predicting and interpreting complex organic molecule
abundances in photon-dominated regions across a range of scales.</p>
