          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The global climate crisis poses new risks to humanity, and with them, new
challenges to the practices of professional astronomy. Avoiding the more
catastrophic consequences of global warming by more than 1.5 degrees requires
an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the 2018
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel report, this will necessitate a 45%
reduction of emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Efforts are
required at all levels, from the individual to the governmental, and every
discipline must find ways to achieve these goals. This will be especially
difficult for astronomy with its significant reliance on conference and
research travel, among other impacts. However, our long-range planning
exercises provide the means to coordinate our response on a variety of levels.
We have the opportunity to lead by example, rising to the challenge rather than
reacting to external constraints.
  We explore how astronomy can meet the challenge of a changing climate in
clear and responsible ways, such as how we set expectations (for ourselves, our
institutions, and our granting agencies) around scientific travel, the
organization of conferences, and the design of our infrastructure. We also
emphasize our role as reliable communicators of scientific information on a
problem that is both human and planetary in scale.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose a novel active learning scheme for automatically sampling a
minimum number of uncorrelated configurations for fitting the Gaussian
Approximation Potential (GAP). Our active learning scheme consists of an
unsupervised machine learning (ML) scheme coupled to Bayesian optimization
technique that evaluates the GAP model. We apply this scheme to a Hafnium
dioxide (HfO2) dataset generated from a melt-quench ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) protocol. Our results show that the active learning scheme,
with no prior knowledge of the dataset is able to extract a configuration that
reaches the required energy fit tolerance. Further, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations performed using this active learned GAP model on 6144-atom systems
of amorphous and liquid state elucidate the structural properties of HfO2 with
near ab initio precision and quench rates (i.e. 1.0 K/ps) not accessible via
AIMD. The melt and amorphous x-ray structural factors generated from our
simulation are in good agreement with experiment. Additionally, the calculated
diffusion constants are in good agreement with previous ab initio studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Grain surfaces play a central role in the formation and desorption of
molecules in space. To form molecules on a grain surface, adsorbed species
trapped in binding sites must be mobile and migrate to adjacent sites. Thermal
hopping is a popular mechanism for the migration of adsorbed species when the
grain surface is warmed up by stellar radiation. However, previous studies
disregarded the fact that grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by
radiative torques (RATs) during grain heating process. To achieve an accurate
model of surface astrochemistry, in this paper, we study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation by RATs on thermal hopping of adsorbed species on icy
grain mantles. We find that centrifugal force due to grain suprathermal
rotation can increase the mobility of radicals on/in the ice mantle compared to
the prediction by thermal hopping, and we term this mechanism ro-thermal
hopping. The rate of ro-thermal hopping depends both on the local radiation
energy density (i.e., grain temperature) and gas density, whereas thermal
hopping only depends on grain temperature. We calculate the decrease in grain
temperature required by ro-thermal hopping to produce the same hopping rate as
thermal hopping and find that it increases with increasing the diffusion energy
and decreasing the gas density. We finally study the effect of grain
suprathermal rotation on the segregation of ice mixtures and find that
ro-thermal segregation of CO$_2$ from H$_2$O-CO$_2$ ices can occur at much
lower temperatures than thermal segregation reported by experiments. Our
results indicate that grain suprathermal rotation can enhance mobility,
formation, desorption, and segregation of molecules in icy grain mantles.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Compressed sensing can increase resolution, and decrease electron dose and
scan time of electron microscope point-scan systems with minimal information
loss. Building on a history of successful deep learning applications in
compressed sensing, we have developed a two-stage multiscale generative
adversarial network to supersample scanning transmission electron micrographs
with point-scan coverage reduced to 1/16, 1/25, ..., 1/100 px. We propose a
novel non-adversarial learning policy to train a unified generator for multiple
coverages and introduce an auxiliary network to homogenize prioritization of
training data with varied signal-to-noise ratios. This achieves root mean
square errors of 3.23% and 4.54% at 1/16 px and 1/100 px coverage,
respectively; within 1% of errors for networks trained for each coverage
individually. Detailed error distributions are presented for unified and
individual coverage generators, including errors per output pixel. In addition,
we present a baseline one-stage network for a single coverage and investigate
numerical precision for web serving. Source code, training data, and pretrained
models are publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffrey-Ede/DLSS-STEM</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the quality of deep learning supersampling for STEM images by developing an adversarial completion method that produces realistic noise characteristics and coloration, unlike non-adversarial methods which produce blurry results.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in deep learning supersampling for STEM images was non-adversarial methods, such as nearest neighbor upsampling and bilinear interpolation, which resulted in blurry or over-smoothed outputs. This paper improved upon these methods by introducing an adversarial completion framework that uses a generative model to learn the mapping between the low-resolution input and the high-resolution output.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper conducted several experiments using a test set of STEM images with different coverage rates (1/16, 1/25, 1/36, and 1/100) to evaluate the performance of the adversarial completion method. The authors also compared their method with non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide the results of the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the adversarial completion method. Figure 1 shows the failure case where detail is too fine, which highlights the limitations of non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the problem of deep learning supersampling and the state of the art in this field. The authors also cited [2, 3, and 4] to support their claims about the limitations of non-adversarial deep learning supersampling methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of medical imaging, as it proposes an adversarial completion method that produces realistic noise characteristics and coloration for STEM images. This could improve the quality of deep learning supersampling methods for these types of images, which are crucial in medical diagnosis and research.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may not perform well when the input image has a very low resolution or when the noise level is very high. They also note that the generative model used in their framework could be improved to produce even more realistic results.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a direct Github repository link for their paper, but they mention that their code and models are available on request.</p>
