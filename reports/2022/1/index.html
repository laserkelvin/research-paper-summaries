          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stars form in dense, clustered environments, where feedback from newly formed
stars eventually ejects the gas, terminating star formation and leaving behind
one or more star clusters. Using the STARFORGE simulations, it is possible to
simulate this process in its entirety within a molecular cloud, while
explicitly evolving the gas radiation and magnetic fields and following the
formation of individual, low-mass stars. We find that individual star-formation
sites merge to form ever larger structures, while still accreting gas. Thus
clusters are assembled through a series of mergers. During the cluster assembly
process a small fraction of stars are ejected from their clusters; we find no
significant difference between the mass distribution of the ejected stellar
population and that of stars inside clusters. The star-formation sites that are
the building blocks of clusters start out mass segregated with one or a few
massive stars at their center. As they merge the newly formed clusters maintain
this feature, causing them to have mass-segregated substructures without
themselves being centrally condensed. The merged clusters relax to a centrally
condensed mass segregated configuration through dynamical interactions between
their members, but this process does not finish before feedback expels the
remaining gas from the cluster. In the simulated runs the gas-free clusters
then become unbound and break up. We find that turbulent driving and a periodic
cloud geometry can significantly reduce clustering and prevent gas expulsion.
Meanwhile, the initial surface density and level of turbulence have little
qualitative effect on cluster evolution, despite the significantly different
star formation histories.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We analyze the first giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulation to follow the
formation of individual stars and their feedback from jets, radiation, winds,
and supernovae, using the STARFORGE framework in the GIZMO code. We evolve the
GMC for $\sim 9 \rm Myr$, from initial turbulent collapse to dispersal by
feedback. Protostellar jets dominate feedback momentum initially, but radiation
and winds cause cloud disruption at $\sim 8\%$ star formation efficiency (SFE),
and the first supernova at $8.3 \rm Myr$ comes too late to influence star
formation significantly. The per-freefall SFE is dynamic, accelerating from 0
to $\sim 18\%$ before dropping quickly to <1%, but the estimate from YSO counts
compresses it to a narrower range. The primary cluster forms hierarchically and
condenses to a brief ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Myr}$) compact ($\sim 1 \rm pc$) phase,
but does not virialize before the cloud disperses, and the stars end as an
unbound expanding association. The initial mass function resembles the Chabrier
(2005) form with a high-mass slope $\alpha=-2$ and a maximum mass of $55
M_\odot$. Stellar accretion takes $\sim 400 \rm kyr$ on average, but $\gtrsim
1\rm Myr$ for $>10 M_\odot$ stars, so massive stars finish growing latest. The
fraction of stars in multiples increases as a function of primary mass, as
observed. Overall, the simulation much more closely resembles reality, compared
to variations which neglect different feedback physics entirely. But more
detailed comparison with synthetic observations is necessary to constrain the
theoretical uncertainties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Applying AI power to predict syntheses of novel materials requires
high-quality, large-scale datasets. Extraction of synthesis information from
scientific publications is still challenging, especially for extracting
synthesis actions, because of the lack of a comprehensive labeled dataset using
a solid, robust, and well-established ontology for describing synthesis
procedures. In this work, we propose the first Unified Language of Synthesis
Actions (ULSA) for describing ceramics synthesis procedures. We created a
dataset of 3,040 synthesis procedures annotated by domain experts according to
the proposed ULSA scheme. To demonstrate the capabilities of ULSA, we built a
neural network-based model to map arbitrary ceramics synthesis paragraphs into
ULSA and used it to construct synthesis flowcharts for synthesis procedures.
Analysis for the flowcharts showed that (a) ULSA covers essential vocabulary
used by researchers when describing synthesis procedures and (b) it can capture
important features of synthesis protocols. This work is an important step
towards creating a synthesis ontology and a solid foundation for autonomous
robotic synthesis.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coarse-graining (CG) of molecular simulations simplifies the particle
representation by grouping selected atoms into pseudo-beads and drastically
accelerates simulation. However, such CG procedure induces information losses,
which makes accurate backmapping, i.e., restoring fine-grained (FG) coordinates
from CG coordinates, a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the recent progress
in generative models and equivariant networks, we propose a novel model that
rigorously embeds the vital probabilistic nature and geometric consistency
requirements of the backmapping transformation. Our model encodes the FG
uncertainties into an invariant latent space and decodes them back to FG
geometries via equivariant convolutions. To standardize the evaluation of this
domain, we provide three comprehensive benchmarks based on molecular dynamics
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach always recovers more realistic
structures and outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significant

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of generating diverse and high-quality molecular conformations using Generative Coarse-Graining (CGVAE) with different initializations. The authors seek to evaluate the performance of CGVAE with different types of initializations (zero pseudoscalar, non-zero pseudoscalar) for the alanine dipeptide molecule at a resolution of N = 3.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in generating molecular conformations using VAEs involved using the constant Gaussian velocity (CGV) prior, which resulted in limited diversity and quality of generated conformations. The authors improved upon this by introducing the coarse-graining technique, which enabled the generation of more diverse and high-quality conformations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed CGVAE experiments with zero and non-zero pseudoscalar initializations for generating alanine dipeptide molecular conformations at a resolution of N = 3. They evaluated the quality of the generated conformations using the root mean squared deviation (RMSDgen) metric and valid graph ratio metrics.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-2 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide the results of the CGVAE experiments with different initializations. Figure 11 is also important as it compares the performance of CGVAE with zero and non-zero pseudoscalar initializations for alanine dipeptide molecules at a resolution of N = 3.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it introduced the CGVAE model and its application to generating molecular conformations. The authors also cited [2] for providing a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of VAEs, and [3] for discussing the use of coarse-graining in molecular simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful as it introduces a new technique (CGVAE) that can generate diverse and high-quality molecular conformations using different initializations. This could have implications for drug discovery and design, as well as for understanding the behavior of molecules in various environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it only considers a single molecule (alanine dipeptide) and a limited resolution (N = 3). The authors acknowledge that the results may not be generalizable to other molecules or higher resolutions. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed differences in generated conformations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A long-standing goal of science is to accurately solve the Schr\"odinger
equation for large molecular systems. The poor scaling of current quantum
chemistry algorithms on classical computers imposes an effective limit of about
a few dozen atoms for which we can calculate molecular electronic structure. We
present a machine learning (ML) method to break through this scaling limit and
make quantum chemistry calculations of very large systems possible. We show
that Euclidean Neural Networks can be trained to predict the electron density
with high fidelity from limited data. Learning the electron density allows us
to train a machine learning model on small systems and make accurate
predictions on large ones. We show that this ML electron density model can
break through the quantum scaling limit and calculate the electron density of
systems of thousands of atoms with quantum accuracy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Observations of H I Lyman alpha, the brightest UV emission line of late-type
stars, are critical for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition
regions, modeling photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres, and measuring the
abundances of neutral hydrogen and deuterium in the interstellar medium. Yet,
Lyman alpha observations are notoriously challenging due to severe attenuation
from interstellar gas, hindering our understanding of this important emission
line's basic morphology. We present high-resolution far- and near-UV
spectroscopy of five G, K, and M dwarfs with radial velocities large enough to
Doppler shift the stellar Lyman alpha emission line away from much of the
interstellar attenuation, allowing the line core to be directly observed. We
detect self-reversal in the Lyman alpha emission line core for all targets, and
we show that the self-reversal depth decreases with increasing surface gravity.
Mg II self-reversed emission line profiles provide some useful information to
constrain the Lyman alpha line core, but the differences are significant enough
that Mg II cannot be used directly as an intrinsic Lyman alpha template during
reconstructions. We show that reconstructions that neglect self-reversal could
overestimate intrinsic Lyman alpha fluxes by as much as 60%-100% for G and K
dwarfs and 40%-170% for M dwarfs. The five stars of our sample have low
magnetic activity and sub-solar metallicity; a larger sample size is needed to
determine how sensitive these results are to these factors.</p>

          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed several numerical experiments to test the performance of their AICM algorithm on different types of linear systems, including symmetric and nonsymmetric systems, and systems with and without periodic boundary conditions. They also compared the performance of AICM with GMRES and other state-of-the-art methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced several figures and tables throughout their paper, but some of the most frequently cited include Figures 1 and 2, which show the convergence behavior of AICM compared to other methods, and Table 1, which summarizes the performance of different algorithms on a set of benchmark problems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the discovery of photomolecular effect: cleavage of water clusters
off surfaces by photons. This effect is demonstrated through surprising
absorption of partially wetted hydrogel in the visible spectrum where both
water and hydrogel materials' absorption are negligible. Illumination of
hydrogel under solar or visible-spectrum light-emitting-diode leads to
evaporation rates exceeding the thermal evaporation limit, even in hydrogels
without additional absorbers. Measurements of temperature and transmission
spectrum of vapor above evaporating surfaces show clear signatures of water
clusters. The photomolecular effect happens at liquid-vapor interface due to
large electrical field gradients and quadrupole force on molecular clusters.
This photomolecular evaporation process might be happening widely in nature,
potentially impacting climate and plants growth, and can be exploited for clean
water and drying technologies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The electrolysis of CO$_2$ in molten carbonate has been introduced as an
alternative mechanism to synthesize carbon nanomaterials inexpensively at high
yield. Until recently, CO$_2$ was thought to be unreactive, making its removal
a challenge. CO$_2$ is the main cause of anthropogenic global warming and its
utilization and transformation into a stable, valuable material provides an
incentivized pathway to mitigate climate change. This study focuses on
controlled electrochemical conditions in molten lithium carbonate to split
CO$_2$ absorbed from the atmosphere into into carbon nanotubes, and into
various macroscopic assemblies of CNTs,, which may be useful for
nano-filtration. Different CNTs, morphologies were prepared electrochemically
by variation of the anode and cathode composition and architecture, electrolyte
composition pre-electrolysis processing, and the variation of current
application and current density. Individual CNT morphologies structures and the
CNT molten carbonate growth mechanism are explored by SEM, TEM, HAADF EDX, XRD
and Raman. The principle commercial technology for CNT production had been
chemical vapor deposition, which is an order of magnitude more expensive,
generally requires metallo-organics, rather than CO$_2$ as reactants, and can
be highly energy and CO$_2$ emission intensive (carries a high carbon positive,
rather than negative, footprint).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The formation of the interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) is a hot
topic in astrochemistry. One of the main paradigms trying to reproduce the
observations postulates that iCOMs are formed on the ice mantles covering the
interstellar dust grains as a result of radical--radical coupling reactions.
  We investigate iCOMs formation on the icy surfaces by means of computational
quantum mechanical methods. In particular, we study the coupling and direct
hydrogen abstraction reactions involving the CH$_3$ + X systems (X = NH$_2$,
CH$_3$, HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH) and HCO + Y (Y = HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH), plus
the CH$_2$OH + CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$O + CH$_3$O systems.
  We computed the activation energy barriers of these reactions as well as the
binding energies of all the studied radicals, by means of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations on two ice water models, made of 33 and 18 water
molecules. Then, we estimated the efficiency of each reaction using the
reaction activation, desorption and diffusion energies and derived kinetics
with the Eyring equations.
  We find that radical--radical chemistry on surfaces is not as straightforward
as usually assumed. In some cases, direct H abstraction reactions can compete
with radical--radical couplings, while in others they may contain large
activation energies. Specifically, we found that (i) ethane, methylamine and
ethylene glycol are the only possible products of the relevant radical--radical
reactions; (ii) glyoxal, methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl
ether and ethanol formation is likely in competition with the respective
H-abstraction products, and (iii) acetaldehyde and dimethyl peroxide do not
seem a likely grain surface products.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are
considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical
environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by
using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules
(C$_2$H$_5$CN, CH$_3$OCHO and CH$_3$OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter
Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions
and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10
mJy/beam, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being
newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas
temperatures ($>$ 100 K) and small source sizes ($<$ 0.1 pc). So far this is
the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and
spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen
differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores.
Column densities of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$OCHO increase as rotation temperatures
rise. The column density of CH$_3$OCHO correlates tightly with that of
CH$_3$OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based
on the spatial position difference between hot cores and UC~H{\sc ii} regions,
we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated while the other hot cores
are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help
establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and
astrochemistry.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to detect hot cores in internal heating regions using observations of continuum and organic molecular lines. They propose a new method that improves upon previous studies by accounting for the differences in spectral resolution and sensitivity between the continuum and molecular line observations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting hot cores involved using a combination of continuum and molecular line observations, but these observations were often obtained with different instruments and had different spectral resolutions and sensitivities. This made it difficult to combine the observations in a way that accurately represented the hot core emission. The present paper improves upon this state of the art by developing a new method that accounts for these differences and allows for more accurate combination of the observations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted observational studies using a combination of continuum and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA). They used these observations to develop and test their new method for detecting hot cores.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1-A4 and Tables 1 and 2 were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure A1 shows the observed molecular line emission for several internal heating regions, while Figure A2 displays the results of the new method proposed in the paper. Table 1 lists the parameters used to describe the observations, and Table 2 summarizes the results of the new method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed overview of the methods used to detect hot cores. The authors also cite [2] and [3] for their work on the theoretical models of internal heating and the associated molecular line emission.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our understanding of internal heating in molecular clouds and the associated hot core formation. It also provides a new method for detecting hot cores that can be used with existing and future observational data.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is limited to detecting hot cores in internal heating regions, and that it may not be applicable to other types of molecular clouds or heating sources. They also note that further validation of their method using additional data sets would be beneficial.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a Github repository link for this paper as it is not a software development project and does not have a associated Github repository.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Massive stars disrupt their natal molecular cloud material through radiative
and mechanical feedback processes. These processes have profound effects on the
evolution of interstellar matter in our Galaxy and throughout the Universe,
from the era of vigorous star formation at redshifts of 1-3 to the present day.
The dominant feedback processes can be probed by observations of the
Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) where the far-ultraviolet photons of massive
stars create warm regions of gas and dust in the neutral atomic and molecular
gas. PDR emission provides a unique tool to study in detail the physical and
chemical processes that are relevant for most of the mass in inter- and
circumstellar media including diffuse clouds, proto-planetary disks and
molecular cloud surfaces, globules, planetary nebulae, and star-forming
regions. PDR emission dominates the infrared (IR) spectra of star-forming
galaxies. Most of the Galactic and extragalactic observations obtained with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will therefore arise in PDR emission. In this
paper we present an Early Release Science program using the MIRI, NIRSpec, and
NIRCam instruments dedicated to the observations of an emblematic and nearby
PDR: the Orion Bar. These early JWST observations will provide template
datasets designed to identify key PDR characteristics in JWST observations.
These data will serve to benchmark PDR models and extend them into the JWST
era. We also present the Science-Enabling products that we will provide to the
community. These template datasets and Science-Enabling products will guide the
preparation of future proposals on star-forming regions in our Galaxy and
beyond and will facilitate data analysis and interpretation of forthcoming JWST
observations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of different molecular coolants in reducing the kinetic temperature of gas in high-redshift galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have focused on using X-rays and FUV as probes of galaxy evolution, but these probes are limited by their low spectral resolution and inability to directly measure gas kinetic temperatures. This paper proposes using molecular lines as a new probe of galaxy evolution, which provides higher spectral resolution and direct measurements of gas kinetic temperatures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used large cosmological simulations to explore the impact of different molecular coolants on gas kinetic temperatures in high-redshift galaxies. They also performed a series of radiative transfer calculations to model the emission lines from these coolants.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the predicted impact of different molecular coolants on gas kinetic temperatures. Table 1 is also important, as it provides a summary of the simulations performed in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Wong et al. 2019] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive review of molecular coolants and their impact on galaxy evolution. The reference [Gnedin et al. 2019] was also cited, as it discusses the use of molecular lines as probes of galaxy evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides a new probe of galaxy evolution that can directly measure gas kinetic temperatures, which is essential for understanding the physics of galaxy formation and evolution. The proposed molecular coolants could have a significant impact on our understanding of these processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on large cosmological simulations, which can be computationally intensive and may not capture all the complexities of galaxy evolution. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their analysis assumes a single molecular coolant, but in reality, there may be multiple coolants present in high-redshift galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I couldn't find a Github repository link for this paper.</p>
