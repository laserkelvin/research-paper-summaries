          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present design considerations for the Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and
Planets in Orion (TEMPO) Survey with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
This proposed 30-day survey is designed to detect a population of transiting
extrasolar satellites, moons, and planets in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).
The young (1-3 Myr), densely-populated ONC harbors about a thousand bright
brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). TEMPO
offers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\rm M}\geq1{\rm
M}_{\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting
FFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up
confirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22)
exomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs.
Of this population, approximately $50\%$ of companions would be "super-Titans"
(Titan to Earth mass). Yield estimates also include approximately $150$
exoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\%$ will orbit
mid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone,
terrestrial ($0.1{\rm M}_{\oplus} - 5{\rm M}_{\oplus}$) exoplanets. TEMPO would
provide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and
BDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the
earliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly
different from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g.,
Earth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield
estimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons
analogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing
theories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty
surrounding detection yields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>On its journey through the Galaxy, the Sun passes through diverse regions of
the interstellar medium. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of
interstellar absorption lines in spectra of nearby stars show absorption
components from more than a dozen warm partially ionized clouds within 15 pc of
the Sun. The two nearest clouds - the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and
Galactic (G) cloud - move toward each other. Their bulk heliocentric velocities
can be compared with the interstellar neutral helium flow velocity obtained
from space-based experiments. We combine recent results from Ulysses, IBEX, and
STEREO observations to find a more accurate estimate of the velocity and
temperature of the very local interstellar medium. We find that, contrary to
the widespread viewpoint that the Sun resides inside the LIC, the locally
observed velocity of the interstellar neutral helium is consistent with a
linear combination of the velocities of the LIC and G cloud, but not with
either of these two velocities. This finding shows that the Sun travels through
a mixed-cloud interstellar medium composed of material from both these clouds.
Interactions between these clouds explain the substantially higher density of
the interstellar hydrogen near the Sun and toward stars located within the
interaction region of these two clouds. The observed asymmetry of the
interstellar helium distribution function also supports this interaction. The
structure and equilibrium in this region require further studies using in situ
and telescopic observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>No existing spherical convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is both
computationally scalable and rotationally equivariant. Continuous approaches
capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally
demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance
but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous
(DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and
computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied
to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical
convolutions exhibit $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance, where
$\text{SO}(n)$ is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in
$n$-dimensions. When restricting rotations of the convolution to the quotient
space $\text{SO}(3)/\text{SO}(2)$ for further computational enhancements, we
recover a form of asymptotic $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance. Through a
sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on
the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical
images we realize a saving of $10^9$ in computational cost and $10^4$ in memory
usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical
convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of
benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere, such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, on all of which we achieve the
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the state-of-the-art in depth estimation from 3D point clouds by using a DISCO (Deeply Supervised Convolutional Operator) architecture with unconstrained directional filters. They want to address the problem of limited view angle and resolution in traditional depth estimation methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art for depth estimation from 3D point clouds was achieved by Zhang et al. (2019), who proposed a U-Net architecture with area-weighted loss and metrics. The authors of this paper improved upon this by using the DISCO architecture, which allows for unconstrained directional filters and simplifies transfer learning from planar to spherical convolutions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors trained their model on the Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017), which contains 7907 spherical RGB images, and predicted spherical depth maps. They downsampled the RGB-Depth images to L = 512 with bilinear interpolation and used area-weighted loss and metrics.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 4, 6, and 7, and Table 1 were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure 4 shows the architecture of the DISCO model, Figure 6 displays example segmentation results, and Figure 7 presents example depth estimation results. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset used for training and evaluation.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is (Zhang et al., 2019), which is mentioned in the context of previous work on depth estimation from 3D point clouds. Other references, such as (Chang et al., 2017) and (Wu & He, 2018), are also cited but to a lesser extent.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a novel architecture for depth estimation from 3D point clouds that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art. The use of unconstrained directional filters and simplification of transfer learning can improve the accuracy and efficiency of depth estimation methods, which is important for real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may be computationally expensive and require large amounts of memory, especially for high-resolution images. They also mention that their method may not perform well with very noisy or incomplete point clouds.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present laboratory rotational spectroscopy of five isomers of cyanoindene
(2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-cyanoindene) using a cavity Fourier-transform microwave
spectrometer operating between 6-40 GHz. Based on these measurements, we report
the detection of 2-cyanoindene (1H-indene-2-carbonitrile; 2-C$_9$H$_7$CN) in
GOTHAM line survey observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the
Green Bank Telescope at centimeter wavelengths. Using a combination of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), spectral stacking, and matched filtering techniques,
we find evidence for the presence of this molecule at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.
This provides the first direct observation of the ratio of a cyano-substituted
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios
predicted by astrochemical models. We conclude that while astrochemical models
are not yet sufficiently accurate to reproduce absolute abundances of these
species, they do a good job at predicting the ratios of
hydrocarbon:CN-substituted species, further solidifying -CN tagged species as
excellent proxies for their fully-symmetric counterparts.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a quantum chemical method for calculating the energies and geometries of the complexes formed after CN addition to an indene ring. The authors aim to provide a more accurate and efficient method than previous studies, which used semi-empirical methods or simplified theoretical frameworks.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies used semi-empirical methods or simplified theoretical frameworks to calculate the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes. These methods were found to be less accurate and less efficient than desired. The present study uses quantum chemical calculations with a more advanced level of theory (U)B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP) and a larger basis set (Gaussian 16 software) to improve upon the previous state of the art.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: No explicit experiments are proposed or carried out in the paper. The authors focus on developing a quantum chemical method for calculating the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures C3 and C4 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the potential energy surface for the CN addition channels and the minimum energy path that the transition states followed. These figures are important for confirming the connection between the appropriate reactants and products and understanding the reaction mechanism.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Frisch et al., 2016) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a basis for the quantum chemical method used in the study. The reference is mentioned in the context of describing the software and level of theory used for the calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it provides a more accurate and efficient method for calculating the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes, which are important intermediates in chemical reactions. The proposed method can be applied to other reactions involving functional groups similar to CN, which could lead to a deeper understanding of their reaction mechanisms and potential applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors mention that the present study is limited to the indene ring system and does not address more complex molecular systems. Additionally, the level of theory used may not be the most advanced, which could result in less accurate calculations for certain complexes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present laboratory rotational spectroscopy of five isomers of cyanoindene
(2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-cyanoindene) using a cavity Fourier-transform microwave
spectrometer operating between 6-40 GHz. Based on these measurements, we report
the detection of 2-cyanoindene (1H-indene-2-carbonitrile; 2-C$_9$H$_7$CN) in
GOTHAM line survey observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the
Green Bank Telescope at centimeter wavelengths. Using a combination of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), spectral stacking, and matched filtering techniques,
we find evidence for the presence of this molecule at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.
This provides the first direct observation of the ratio of a cyano-substituted
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Laboratory experiments have confirmed that the radiolytic decay rate of
astrochemical ice analogues is dependent upon the solid phase of the target
ice, with some crystalline molecular ices being more radio-resistant than their
amorphous counterparts. The degree of radio-resistance exhibited by crystalline
ice phases is dependent upon the nature, strength, and extent of the
intermolecular interactions that characterise their solid structure. For
example, it has been shown that crystalline CH3OH decays at a significantly
slower rate when irradiated by 2 keV electrons at 20 K than does the amorphous
phase due to the stabilising effect imparted by the presence of an extensive
array of strong hydrogen bonds. These results have important consequences for
the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and outer Solar System bodies, as they
imply that the chemical products arising from the irradiation of amorphous ices
(which may include prebiotic molecules relevant to biology) should be more
abundant than those arising from similar irradiations of crystalline phases. In
this present study, we have extended our work on this subject by performing
comparative energetic electron irradiations of the amorphous and crystalline
phases of the sulphur-bearing molecules H2S and SO2 at 20 K. We have found
evidence for phase-dependent chemistry in both these species, with the
radiation-induced exponential decay of amorphous H2S being more rapid than that
of the crystalline phase, similar to the effect that has been previously
observed for CH3OH. For SO2, two fluence regimes are apparent: a low-fluence
regime in which the crystalline ice exhibits a rapid exponential decay while
the amorphous ice possibly resists decay, and a high-fluence regime in which
both phases undergo slow exponential-like decays.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the efficient production of S8 in interstellar ices through cosmic-ray-driven radiation chemistry and nondiffusive bulk reactions.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have shown that S8 can be produced through radiolytic processes in interstellar ices, but the efficiency of these processes is not well understood.

          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed ab initio calculations to determine the reactivity of S6 and O2 towards the formation of S8, and they used a comprehensive set of experimental conditions to evaluate the efficiency of S8 production in interstellar ices. They also studied the effects of cosmic-ray-driven radiation chemistry and nondiffusive bulk reactions on S8 production in interstellar ices.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures and tables show the calculated reactivity of S6 and O2 towards the formation of S8, the experimental conditions used to evaluate S8 production in interstellar ices, and the results of these experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference by Wallner et al. (2022) was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of abiotic molecular oxygen production and its relevance to interstellar ices. The reference by Yarnall and Hudson (2022) was also cited frequently, as it provides information on the densities of crystalline ices that are relevant to planetary and interstellar applications.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to impact our understanding of S8 production in interstellar ices, which can help us better understand the chemistry of these environments and how they may have evolved over time.

          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their calculations are based on simplified assumptions, such as the neglect of spin-orbit coupling and the assumption of a uniform cosmic-ray flux. These simplifications may limit the accuracy of their results and should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of this study.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We develop a polycrystal graph neural network (PGNN) model for predicting the
effective properties of polycrystalline materials, using the Li7La3Zr2O12
ceramic as an example. A large-scale dataset with >5000 different
three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures of finite-width grain
boundary is generated by Voronoi tessellation and processing of the electron
backscatter diffraction images. The effective ion conductivities and elastic
stiffness coefficients of these microstructures are calculated by
high-throughput physics-based simulations. The optimized PGNN model achieves a
low error of <1.4% in predicting all three diagonal components of the effective
Li-ion conductivity matrix, outperforming a linear regression model and two
baseline convolutional neural network models. Sequential forward selection
method is used to quantify the relative importance of selecting individual
grain (boundary) features to improving the property prediction accuracy,
through which both the critical and unwanted node (edge) feature can be
determined. The extrapolation performance of the trained PGNN model is also
investigated. The transfer learning performance is evaluated by using the PGNN
model pretrained for predicting conductivities to predict the elastic
properties of the same set of microstructures.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to solve the problem of developing a deep learning model that can accurately simulate complex physical systems, such as those involving nonlinear partial differential equations. The authors argue that current methods for solving these types of problems are limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions and numerical approximations, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and missed insights.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in physics-informed machine learning involved using neural networks to approximate solutions to partial differential equations. However, these models were limited by their reliance on simple feedforward architectures and their inability to incorporate physical constraints in a meaningful way. The present paper introduces a new framework called "physics-informed neural networks" (PINNs), which combines the power of deep learning with the physical laws governing a system to produce more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of their PINN framework. These include solving the Poisson equation, the Navier-Stokes equation, and the Schrödinger equation using a variety of different network architectures and training protocols. They also compare the performance of their models with traditional numerical methods and show that they can produce more accurate solutions in many cases.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several figures and tables throughout the paper, but the most frequently referenced are Figures 1, 2, and 3, which demonstrate the performance of their PINN framework on different types of problems. Table 1 is also referenced early in the paper to provide an overview of the different network architectures considered in their experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references throughout the paper, but the most frequently cited are related to the development and application of deep learning models for solving partial differential equations. These citations are provided in the context of discussing the limitations of traditional methods and the potential benefits of using PINNs.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it introduces a new framework for solving complex physical problems that combines the power of deep learning with the physical laws governing a system. This could lead to more accurate predictions and better understanding of complex systems in a wide range of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge several limitations of their PINN framework, including the need for large amounts of training data and computational resources, as well as the potential for overfitting or poor generalization to new situations. They also note that their framework is currently limited to solving problems in which the physical laws are known, and that there is a need for further research on how to incorporate uncertainty and ambiguity into the modeling process.</p>

          <p>Climate change motivates the search for non-carbon-emitting energy generation
and storage solutions. Metal hydrides show promising characteristics for this
purpose. They can be further stabilized by tailoring the negative pressure of
microstructural and structural defects. Using systematic ab initio and
atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that an enhancement in the formation of
hydrides at the negatively pressurized crack tip region is feasible by
increasing the mechanical tensile load on the specimen. The theoretical
predictions have been used to reassess and interpret atom probe tomography
experiments for a high-strength 7XXX-aluminium alloy that show a substantial
enhancement of hydrogen concentration at structural defects near a
stress-corrosion crack tip. These results contain important implications for
enhancing the capability of metals as H-storage materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular pretraining, which learns molecular representations over massive
unlabeled data, has become a prominent paradigm to solve a variety of tasks in
computational chemistry and drug discovery. Recently, prosperous progress has
been made in molecular pretraining with different molecular featurizations,
including 1D SMILES strings, 2D graphs, and 3D geometries. However, the role of
molecular featurizations with their corresponding neural architectures in
molecular pretraining remains largely unexamined. In this paper, through two
case studies -- chirality classification and aromatic ring counting -- we first
demonstrate that different featurization techniques convey chemical information
differently. In light of this observation, we propose a simple and effective
MOlecular pretraining framework with COmplementary featurizations (MOCO). MOCO
comprehensively leverages multiple featurizations that complement each other
and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models that solely relies on one or
two featurizations on a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate and efficient prediction of polymer properties is of great
significance in polymer design. Conventionally, expensive and time-consuming
experiments or simulations are required to evaluate polymer functions.
Recently, Transformer models, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, have
exhibited superior performance in natural language processing. However, such
methods have not been investigated in polymer sciences. Herein, we report
TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer property
prediction. Our proposed polymer tokenizer with chemical awareness enables
learning representations from polymer sequences. Rigorous experiments on ten
polymer property prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of
TransPolymer. Moreover, we show that TransPolymer benefits from pretraining on
large unlabeled dataset via Masked Language Modeling. Experimental results
further manifest the important role of self-attention in modeling polymer
sequences. We highlight this model as a promising computational tool for
promoting rational polymer design and understanding structure-property
relationships from a data science view.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Self-supervised neural language models have recently found wide applications
in generative design of organic molecules and protein sequences as well as
representation learning for downstream structure classification and functional
prediction. However, most of the existing deep learning models for molecule
design usually require a big dataset and have a black-box architecture, which
makes it difficult to interpret their design logic. Here we propose Generative
Molecular Transformer (GMTransformer), a probabilistic neural network model for
generative design of molecules. Our model is built on the blank filling
language model originally developed for text processing, which has demonstrated
unique advantages in learning the "molecules grammars" with high-quality
generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. Benchmarked on the MOSES
datasets, our models achieve high novelty and Scaf compared to other baselines.
The probabilistic generation steps have the potential in tinkering molecule
design due to their capability of recommending how to modify existing molecules
with explanation, guided by the learned implicit molecule chemistry. The source
code and datasets can be accessed freely at

A: The authors aim to develop a robust and efficient method for generating molecular structures with desired properties, specifically focusing on the representation of molecular structures. They identify that traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features or templates, which can be limited in their ability to capture complex chemical properties.

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, previous methods for generating molecular structures relied on hand-crafted features or templates, which were limited in their ability to capture complex chemical properties. These methods often resulted in a high number of false positives and negatives when evaluating the generated structures against a set of desired properties. The proposed selﬁe representation improves upon these previous methods by learning a robust and efficient representation of molecular structures that can be used for generating structures with desired properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their selFIE representation, including (1) training a machine learning model on a set of known molecules to predict their properties, (2) using the selFIE representation to generate new molecular structures with desired properties, and (3) comparing the predicted properties of the generated structures against those of the known molecules.</p>

This could have significant implications for drug discovery and development, as well as other applications in chemical engineering and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on machine learning algorithms, which may not be accessible or interpretable to all readers. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their proposed representation may not capture all possible properties of molecular structures, which could limit its applicability in certain contexts.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Ice cores are known to yield information about astronomical phenomena as well
as information about past climate. We report time series analyses of annually
resolved nitrate variations in an ice core, drilled at the Dome Fuji station in
East Antarctica, corresponding to the period from CE 1610 to 1904. Our analyses
revealed clear evidence of ~11, ~22, and ~90 year periodicities, comparable to
the respective periodicities of the well-known Schwabe, Hale, and Gleissberg
solar cycles. Our results show for the first time that nitrate concentrations
in an ice core can be used as a proxy for past solar activity on decadal to
multidecadal time scales. Furthermore, 11-year and 22-year periodicities were
detected in nitrate variations even during the Maunder Minimum (1645-1715),
when sunspots were almost absent. This discovery may support cyclic behavior of
the solar dynamo during the grand solar minimum.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to reconstruct the power spectrum of solar variability over the past 400 years using a new method that incorporates both spectral and temporal information. The authors seek to improve upon previous methods that have limited temporal resolution or rely on indirect proxies for solar variability.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in reconstructing solar power spectra involved using indirect proxies such as tree rings, ice cores, and historical records. These methods have limitations in terms of temporal resolution and accuracy, particularly for periods before the instrumental record. This paper improves upon these methods by using a direct proxy (NO3 concentrations) with high temporal resolution and combining it with spectral analysis techniques to reconstruct the power spectrum of solar variability.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of spectral analysis techniques, including the Maximum Entropy Method and the Lomb-Scargle method, to reconstruct the power spectrum of solar variability from 1610 to 2010. They also applied a Butterworth filter to the data to remove high-frequency noise.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 4 and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the reconstructed power spectra of solar variability using different methods and highlight the potential impact of the proposed method on our understanding of solar variability.

A: The reference [HS98] is cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed analysis of the solar cycle and its relationship to solar variability. The authors also cite [C17] for the description of the Butterworth filter used in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our understanding of solar variability over the past 400 years, which is crucial for understanding the role of solar activity in climate variability and predicting future changes in solar output. The proposed method can also be applied to other environmental proxies, such as atmospheric gases or sediment cores, to reconstruct the power spectrum of natural climate variability.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is the limited temporal resolution of the NO3 concentration data, which may limit the accuracy of the reconstructed power spectrum over longer time scales. Additionally, the authors note that their method assumes that the solar signal in the NO3 concentrations is primarily due to changes in solar irradiance, which may not be the only factor influencing the observed variability.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Solar plages, which are bright regions on the Sun's surface, are an important
indicator of solar activity. In this study, we propose an automated algorithm
for identifying solar plages in Ca K wavelength solar data obtained from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. The algorithm successfully annotates all visually
identifiable plages in an image and outputs the corresponding calculated plage
index. We perform a time series analysis of the plage index (rolling mean)
across multiple solar cycles to test the algorithm's reliability and
robustness. The results show a strong correlation between the calculated plage
index and those reported in a previous study. The correlation coefficients
obtained for all the solar cycles are higher than 0.90, indicating the
reliability of the model. We also suggest that adjusting the hyperparameters
appropriately for a specific image using our web-based app can increase the
model's efficiency. The algorithm has been deployed on the Streamlit Community
Cloud platform, where users can upload images and customize the hyperparameters
for desired results. The input data used in this study is freely available from
the KSO data archive, and the code and the generated data are publicly
available on our GitHub repository. Our proposed algorithm provides an
efficient and reliable method for identifying solar plages, which can aid the
study of solar activity and its impact on the Earth's climate, technology, and
space weather.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The total solar irradiance (TSI) varies on timescales of minute to centuries.
On short timescales it varies due to the superposition of intensity
fluctuations produced by turbulent convection and acoustic oscillations. On
longer scale times, it changes due to photospheric magnetic activity, mainly
because of the facular brightenings and dimmings caused by sunspots. While
modern TSI variations have been monitored from space since 1970s, TSI
variations over much longer periods can only be estimated using either
historical observations of magnetic features, possibly supported by flux
transport models, or from the measurements of the cosmogenic isotope (e.g.,
\textsuperscript{14}C or \textsuperscript{10}Be) concentrations in tree rings
and ice cores. The reconstruction of the TSI in the last few centuries,
particularly in the 17th/18th centuries during the Maunder minimum, is of
primary importance for studying climatic effects. To separate the temporal
components of the irradiance variations, specifically the magnetic cycle from
secular variability, we decomposed the signals associated with historical
observations of magnetic features and the solar modulation potential $\Phi$ by
applying an Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm. Thus, the reconstruction is
empirical and does not require any feature contrast or field transport model.
The assessed difference between the mean value during the Maunder minimum and
the present value is $\simeq2.5 Wm^{-2}$. Moreover it shows, in the first half
of the last century, a growth of $\simeq 1.5 W m^{-2}$ which stops around the
middle of the century to remain constant for the next 50 years, apart from the
modulation due to the solar cycle.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar flares of active M dwarfs can affect the atmospheric composition of
close-orbiting gas giants, and can result in time-dependent transmission
spectra. We aim to examine the impact of a variety of flares, differing in
energy, duration, and occurrence frequency, on the composition and spectra of
close-orbiting, tidally locked gaseous planets with climates dominated by
equatorial superrotation. We used a series of pseudo-2D photo- and
thermochemical kinetics models, which take advection by the equatorial jet
stream into account, to simulate the neutral molecular composition of a gaseous
planet (effective temperature 800 K) that orbits a flaring M dwarf. We then
computed transmission spectra for the evening and morning limb. We find that
the upper regions of the dayside and evening limb are heavily depleted in CH4
and NH3 up to several days after a flare with a total radiative energy of $ 2
\times 10^{33} $ erg. Molar fractions of C2H2 and HCN are enhanced up to a
factor three on the nightside and morning limb after day-to-nightside advection
of photodissociated species. CH4 depletion reduces transit depths by 100-300
parts per million (ppm) on the evening limb and C2H2 production increases the
14 micron feature up to 350 ppm on the morning limb. We find that repeated
flaring drives the atmosphere to a composition that differs from its pre-flare
distribution and that this translates to a permanent modification of the
transmission spectrum. We show that single high-energy flares can affect the
atmospheres of close-orbiting gas giants up to several days after the flare
event, during which their transmission spectra are altered by several hundred
ppm. Repeated flaring has important implications for future retrieval analyses
of exoplanets around active stars, as the atmospheric composition and resulting
spectral signatures substantially differ from models that do not include
flaring.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) of the European Space Agency
(ESA) will be the first low-frequency gravitational-wave observatory orbiting
the Sun at 1 AU. The LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission, aiming at testing of the
instruments to be located on board the LISA spacecraft (S/C), hosted, among the
others, fluxgate magnetometers and a particle detector as parts of a
diagnostics subsystem. These instruments allowed us for the estimate of the
magnetic and Coulomb spurious forces acting on the test masses that constitute
the mirrors of the interferometer. With these instruments we also had the
possibility to study the galactic cosmic-ray short term-term variations as a
function of the particle energy and the associated interplanetary disturbances.
Platform magnetometers and particle detectors will be also placed on board each
LISA S/C. This work reports about an empirical method that allowed us to
disentangle the interplanetary and onboard-generated components of the magnetic
field by using the LPF magnetometer measurements. Moreover, we estimate the
number and fluence of solar energetic particle events expected to be observed
with the ESA Next Generation Radiation Monitor during the mission lifetime. An
additional cosmic-ray detector, similar to that designed for LPF, in
combination with magnetometers, would permit to observe the evolution of
recurrent and non-recurrent galactic cosmic-ray variations and associated
increases of the interplanetary magnetic field at the transit of high-speed
solar wind streams and interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections.
The diagnostics subsystem of LISA makes this mission also a natural multi-point
observatory for space weather science investigations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Solar plages, which are bright regions on the Sun's surface, are an important
indicator of solar activity. In this study, we propose an automated algorithm
for identifying solar plages in Ca K wavelength solar data obtained from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. The algorithm successfully annotates all visually
identifiable plages in an image and outputs the corresponding calculated plage
index. We perform a time series analysis of the plage index (rolling mean)
across multiple solar cycles to test the algorithm's reliability and
robustness. The results show a strong correlation between the calculated plage
index and those reported in a previous study. The correlation coefficients
obtained for all the solar cycles are higher than 0.90, indicating the
reliability of the model. We also suggest that adjusting the hyperparameters
appropriately for a specific image using our web-based app can increase the
model's efficiency. The algorithm has been deployed on the Streamlit Community
Cloud platform, where users can upload images and customize the hyperparameters
for desired results. The input data used in this study is freely available from
the KSO data archive, and the code and the generated data are publicly
available on our GitHub repository. Our proposed algorithm provides an
efficient and reliable method for identifying solar plages, which can aid the
study of solar activity and its impact on the Earth's climate, technology, and
space weather.</p>
