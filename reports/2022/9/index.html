          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present design considerations for the Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and
Planets in Orion (TEMPO) Survey with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
This proposed 30-day survey is designed to detect a population of transiting
extrasolar satellites, moons, and planets in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).
The young (1-3 Myr), densely-populated ONC harbors about a thousand bright
brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). TEMPO
offers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\rm M}\geq1{\rm
M}_{\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting
FFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up
confirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22)
exomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs.
Of this population, approximately $50\%$ of companions would be "super-Titans"
(Titan to Earth mass). Yield estimates also include approximately $150$
exoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\%$ will orbit
mid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone,
terrestrial ($0.1{\rm M}_{\oplus} - 5{\rm M}_{\oplus}$) exoplanets. TEMPO would
provide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and
BDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the
earliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly
different from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g.,
Earth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield
estimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons
analogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing
theories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty
surrounding detection yields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>On its journey through the Galaxy, the Sun passes through diverse regions of
the interstellar medium. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of
interstellar absorption lines in spectra of nearby stars show absorption
components from more than a dozen warm partially ionized clouds within 15 pc of
the Sun. The two nearest clouds - the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and
Galactic (G) cloud - move toward each other. Their bulk heliocentric velocities
can be compared with the interstellar neutral helium flow velocity obtained
from space-based experiments. We combine recent results from Ulysses, IBEX, and
STEREO observations to find a more accurate estimate of the velocity and
temperature of the very local interstellar medium. We find that, contrary to
the widespread viewpoint that the Sun resides inside the LIC, the locally
observed velocity of the interstellar neutral helium is consistent with a
linear combination of the velocities of the LIC and G cloud, but not with
either of these two velocities. This finding shows that the Sun travels through
a mixed-cloud interstellar medium composed of material from both these clouds.
Interactions between these clouds explain the substantially higher density of
the interstellar hydrogen near the Sun and toward stars located within the
interaction region of these two clouds. The observed asymmetry of the
interstellar helium distribution function also supports this interaction. The
structure and equilibrium in this region require further studies using in situ
and telescopic observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>No existing spherical convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is both
computationally scalable and rotationally equivariant. Continuous approaches
capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally
demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance
but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous
(DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and
computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied
to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical
convolutions exhibit $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance, where
$\text{SO}(n)$ is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in
$n$-dimensions. When restricting rotations of the convolution to the quotient
space $\text{SO}(3)/\text{SO}(2)$ for further computational enhancements, we
recover a form of asymptotic $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance. Through a
sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on
the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical
images we realize a saving of $10^9$ in computational cost and $10^4$ in memory
usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical
convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of
benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere, such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, on all of which we achieve the
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the state-of-the-art in depth estimation from 3D point clouds by using a DISCO (Deeply Supervised Convolutional Operator) architecture with unconstrained directional filters. They want to address the problem of limited view angle and resolution in traditional depth estimation methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art for depth estimation from 3D point clouds was achieved by Zhang et al. (2019), who proposed a U-Net architecture with area-weighted loss and metrics. The authors of this paper improved upon this by using the DISCO architecture, which allows for unconstrained directional filters and simplifies transfer learning from planar to spherical convolutions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors trained their model on the Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017), which contains 7907 spherical RGB images, and predicted spherical depth maps. They downsampled the RGB-Depth images to L = 512 with bilinear interpolation and used area-weighted loss and metrics.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 4, 6, and 7, and Table 1 were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure 4 shows the architecture of the DISCO model, Figure 6 displays example segmentation results, and Figure 7 presents example depth estimation results. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset used for training and evaluation.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is (Zhang et al., 2019), which is mentioned in the context of previous work on depth estimation from 3D point clouds. Other references, such as (Chang et al., 2017) and (Wu & He, 2018), are also cited but to a lesser extent.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a novel architecture for depth estimation from 3D point clouds that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art. The use of unconstrained directional filters and simplification of transfer learning can improve the accuracy and efficiency of depth estimation methods, which is important for real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may be computationally expensive and require large amounts of memory, especially for high-resolution images. They also mention that their method may not perform well with very noisy or incomplete point clouds.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present laboratory rotational spectroscopy of five isomers of cyanoindene
(2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-cyanoindene) using a cavity Fourier-transform microwave
spectrometer operating between 6-40 GHz. Based on these measurements, we report
the detection of 2-cyanoindene (1H-indene-2-carbonitrile; 2-C$_9$H$_7$CN) in
GOTHAM line survey observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the
Green Bank Telescope at centimeter wavelengths. Using a combination of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), spectral stacking, and matched filtering techniques,
we find evidence for the presence of this molecule at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.
This provides the first direct observation of the ratio of a cyano-substituted
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios
predicted by astrochemical models. We conclude that while astrochemical models
are not yet sufficiently accurate to reproduce absolute abundances of these
species, they do a good job at predicting the ratios of
hydrocarbon:CN-substituted species, further solidifying -CN tagged species as
excellent proxies for their fully-symmetric counterparts.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a quantum chemical method for calculating the energies and geometries of the complexes formed after CN addition to an indene ring. The authors aim to provide a more accurate and efficient method than previous studies, which used semi-empirical methods or simplified theoretical frameworks.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies used semi-empirical methods or simplified theoretical frameworks to calculate the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes. These methods were found to be less accurate and less efficient than desired. The present study uses quantum chemical calculations with a more advanced level of theory (U)B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP) and a larger basis set (Gaussian 16 software) to improve upon the previous state of the art.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: No explicit experiments are proposed or carried out in the paper. The authors focus on developing a quantum chemical method for calculating the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures C3 and C4 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the potential energy surface for the CN addition channels and the minimum energy path that the transition states followed. These figures are important for confirming the connection between the appropriate reactants and products and understanding the reaction mechanism.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Frisch et al., 2016) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a basis for the quantum chemical method used in the study. The reference is mentioned in the context of describing the software and level of theory used for the calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it provides a more accurate and efficient method for calculating the energies and geometries of CN addition complexes, which are important intermediates in chemical reactions. The proposed method can be applied to other reactions involving functional groups similar to CN, which could lead to a deeper understanding of their reaction mechanisms and potential applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present laboratory rotational spectroscopy of five isomers of cyanoindene
(2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-cyanoindene) using a cavity Fourier-transform microwave
spectrometer operating between 6-40 GHz. Based on these measurements, we report
the detection of 2-cyanoindene (1H-indene-2-carbonitrile; 2-C$_9$H$_7$CN) in
GOTHAM line survey observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the
Green Bank Telescope at centimeter wavelengths. Using a combination of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), spectral stacking, and matched filtering techniques,
we find evidence for the presence of this molecule at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.
This provides the first direct observation of the ratio of a cyano-substituted
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios
predicted by astrochemical models. We conclude that while astrochemical models
are not yet sufficiently accurate to reproduce absolute abundances of these
species, they do a good job at predicting the ratios of
hydrocarbon:CN-substituted species, further solidifying -CN tagged species as
excellent proxies for their fully-symmetric counterparts.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Laboratory experiments have confirmed that the radiolytic decay rate of
astrochemical ice analogues is dependent upon the solid phase of the target
ice, with some crystalline molecular ices being more radio-resistant than their
amorphous counterparts. The degree of radio-resistance exhibited by crystalline
ice phases is dependent upon the nature, strength, and extent of the
intermolecular interactions that characterise their solid structure. For
example, it has been shown that crystalline CH3OH decays at a significantly
slower rate when irradiated by 2 keV electrons at 20 K than does the amorphous
phase due to the stabilising effect imparted by the presence of an extensive
array of strong hydrogen bonds. These results have important consequences for
the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and outer Solar System bodies, as they
imply that the chemical products arising from the irradiation of amorphous ices
(which may include prebiotic molecules relevant to biology) should be more
abundant than those arising from similar irradiations of crystalline phases. In
this present study, we have extended our work on this subject by performing
comparative energetic electron irradiations of the amorphous and crystalline
phases of the sulphur-bearing molecules H2S and SO2 at 20 K. We have found
evidence for phase-dependent chemistry in both these species, with the
radiation-induced exponential decay of amorphous H2S being more rapid than that
of the crystalline phase, similar to the effect that has been previously
observed for CH3OH. For SO2, two fluence regimes are apparent: a low-fluence
regime in which the crystalline ice exhibits a rapid exponential decay while
the amorphous ice possibly resists decay, and a high-fluence regime in which
both phases undergo slow exponential-like decays.</p>

A: The authors performed ab initio calculations to determine the reactivity of S6 and O2 towards the formation of S8, and they used a comprehensive set of experimental conditions to evaluate the efficiency of S8 production in interstellar ices. They also studied the effects of cosmic-ray-driven radiation chemistry and nondiffusive bulk reactions on S8 production in interstellar ices.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text.

          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their calculations are based on simplified assumptions, such as the neglect of spin-orbit coupling and the assumption of a uniform cosmic-ray flux. These simplifications may limit the accuracy of their results and should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of this study.</p>

          <p>We develop a polycrystal graph neural network (PGNN) model for predicting the
effective properties of polycrystalline materials, using the Li7La3Zr2O12
ceramic as an example. A large-scale dataset with >5000 different
three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures of finite-width grain
boundary is generated by Voronoi tessellation and processing of the electron
backscatter diffraction images. The effective ion conductivities and elastic
stiffness coefficients of these microstructures are calculated by
high-throughput physics-based simulations. The optimized PGNN model achieves a
low error of <1.4% in predicting all three diagonal components of the effective
Li-ion conductivity matrix, outperforming a linear regression model and two
baseline convolutional neural network models. Sequential forward selection
method is used to quantify the relative importance of selecting individual
grain (boundary) features to improving the property prediction accuracy,
through which both the critical and unwanted node (edge) feature can be
determined. The extrapolation performance of the trained PGNN model is also
investigated. The transfer learning performance is evaluated by using the PGNN
model pretrained for predicting conductivities to predict the elastic
properties of the same set of microstructures.</p>

The authors argue that current methods for solving these types of problems are limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions and numerical approximations, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and missed insights.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in physics-informed machine learning involved using neural networks to approximate solutions to partial differential equations. However, these models were limited by their reliance on simple feedforward architectures and their inability to incorporate physical constraints in a meaningful way. The present paper introduces a new framework called "physics-informed neural networks" (PINNs), which combines the power of deep learning with the physical laws governing a system to produce more accurate predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of their PINN framework. These include solving the Poisson equation, the Navier-Stokes equation, and the Schrödinger equation using a variety of different network architectures and training protocols. They also compare the performance of their models with traditional numerical methods and show that they can produce more accurate solutions in many cases.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several figures and tables throughout the paper, but the most frequently referenced are Figures 1, 2, and 3, which demonstrate the performance of their PINN framework on different types of problems. Table 1 is also referenced early in the paper to provide an overview of the different network architectures considered in their experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references throughout the paper, but the most frequently cited are related to the development and application of deep learning models for solving partial differential equations. These citations are provided in the context of discussing the limitations of traditional methods and the potential benefits of using PINNs.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it introduces a new framework for solving complex physical problems that combines the power of deep learning with the physical laws governing a system. This could lead to more accurate predictions and better understanding of complex systems in a wide range of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge several limitations of their PINN framework, including the need for large amounts of training data and computational resources, as well as the potential for overfitting or poor generalization to new situations. They also note that their framework is currently limited to solving problems in which the physical laws are known, and that there is a need for further research on how to incorporate uncertainty and ambiguity into the modeling process.</p>

          <p>Climate change motivates the search for non-carbon-emitting energy generation
and storage solutions. Metal hydrides show promising characteristics for this
purpose. They can be further stabilized by tailoring the negative pressure of
microstructural and structural defects. Using systematic ab initio and
atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that an enhancement in the formation of
hydrides at the negatively pressurized crack tip region is feasible by
increasing the mechanical tensile load on the specimen. The theoretical
predictions have been used to reassess and interpret atom probe tomography
experiments for a high-strength 7XXX-aluminium alloy that show a substantial
enhancement of hydrogen concentration at structural defects near a
stress-corrosion crack tip. These results contain important implications for
enhancing the capability of metals as H-storage materials.</p>
