          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present design considerations for the Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and
Planets in Orion (TEMPO) Survey with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
This proposed 30-day survey is designed to detect a population of transiting
extrasolar satellites, moons, and planets in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).
The young (1-3 Myr), densely-populated ONC harbors about a thousand bright
brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). TEMPO
offers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\rm M}\geq1{\rm
M}_{\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting
FFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up
confirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22)
exomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs.
Of this population, approximately $50\%$ of companions would be "super-Titans"
(Titan to Earth mass). Yield estimates also include approximately $150$
exoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\%$ will orbit
mid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone,
terrestrial ($0.1{\rm M}_{\oplus} - 5{\rm M}_{\oplus}$) exoplanets. TEMPO would
provide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and
BDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the
earliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly
different from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g.,
Earth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield
estimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons
analogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing
theories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty
surrounding detection yields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>On its journey through the Galaxy, the Sun passes through diverse regions of
the interstellar medium. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of
interstellar absorption lines in spectra of nearby stars show absorption
components from more than a dozen warm partially ionized clouds within 15 pc of
the Sun. The two nearest clouds - the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and
Galactic (G) cloud - move toward each other. Their bulk heliocentric velocities
can be compared with the interstellar neutral helium flow velocity obtained
from space-based experiments. We combine recent results from Ulysses, IBEX, and
STEREO observations to find a more accurate estimate of the velocity and
temperature of the very local interstellar medium. We find that, contrary to
the widespread viewpoint that the Sun resides inside the LIC, the locally
observed velocity of the interstellar neutral helium is consistent with a
linear combination of the velocities of the LIC and G cloud, but not with
either of these two velocities. This finding shows that the Sun travels through
a mixed-cloud interstellar medium composed of material from both these clouds.
Interactions between these clouds explain the substantially higher density of
the interstellar hydrogen near the Sun and toward stars located within the
interaction region of these two clouds. The observed asymmetry of the
interstellar helium distribution function also supports this interaction. The
structure and equilibrium in this region require further studies using in situ
and telescopic observations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>No existing spherical convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is both
computationally scalable and rotationally equivariant. Continuous approaches
capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally
demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance
but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous
(DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and
computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied
to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical
convolutions exhibit $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance, where
$\text{SO}(n)$ is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in
$n$-dimensions. When restricting rotations of the convolution to the quotient
space $\text{SO}(3)/\text{SO}(2)$ for further computational enhancements, we
recover a form of asymptotic $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance. Through a
sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on
the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical
images we realize a saving of $10^9$ in computational cost and $10^4$ in memory
usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical
convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of
benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere, such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, on all of which we achieve the
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the state-of-the-art in depth estimation from 3D point clouds by using a DISCO (Deeply Supervised Convolutional Operator) architecture with unconstrained directional filters. They want to address the problem of limited view angle and resolution in traditional depth estimation methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art for depth estimation from 3D point clouds was achieved by Zhang et al. (2019), who proposed a U-Net architecture with area-weighted loss and metrics. The authors of this paper improved upon this by using the DISCO architecture, which allows for unconstrained directional filters and simplifies transfer learning from planar to spherical convolutions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors trained their model on the Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017), which contains 7907 spherical RGB images, and predicted spherical depth maps. They downsampled the RGB-Depth images to L = 512 with bilinear interpolation and used area-weighted loss and metrics.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 4, 6, and 7, and Table 1 were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure 4 shows the architecture of the DISCO model, Figure 6 displays example segmentation results, and Figure 7 presents example depth estimation results. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset used for training and evaluation.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is (Zhang et al., 2019), which is mentioned in the context of previous work on depth estimation from 3D point clouds. Other references, such as (Chang et al., 2017) and (Wu & He, 2018), are also cited but to a lesser extent.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it proposes a novel architecture for depth estimation from 3D point clouds that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art. The use of unconstrained directional filters and simplification of transfer learning can improve the accuracy and efficiency of depth estimation methods, which is important for real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may be computationally expensive and require large amounts of memory, especially for high-resolution images. They also mention that their method may not perform well with very noisy or incomplete point clouds.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The Github repository link for this paper is not provided in the text.</p>

          <p>We present laboratory rotational spectroscopy of five isomers of cyanoindene
(2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-cyanoindene) using a cavity Fourier-transform microwave
spectrometer operating between 6-40 GHz. Based on these measurements, we report
the detection of 2-cyanoindene (1H-indene-2-carbonitrile; 2-C$_9$H$_7$CN) in
GOTHAM line survey observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the

Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), spectral stacking, and matched filtering techniques,
we find evidence for the presence of this molecule at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.
This provides the first direct observation of the ratio of a cyano-substituted
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios
predicted by astrochemical models. We conclude that while astrochemical models
are not yet sufficiently accurate to reproduce absolute abundances of these

excellent proxies for their fully-symmetric counterparts.</p>

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to its pure hydrocarbon counterpart, in
this case indene, in the same source. We discuss the possible formation
chemistry of this species, including why we have only detected one of the
isomers in TMC-1. We then examine the overall hydrocarbon:CN-substituted ratio
across this and other simpler species, as well as compare to those ratios
predicted by astrochemical models. We conclude that while astrochemical models
are not yet sufficiently accurate to reproduce absolute abundances of these
species, they do a good job at predicting the ratios of
hydrocarbon:CN-substituted species, further solidifying -CN tagged species as
excellent proxies for their fully-symmetric counterparts.</p>
