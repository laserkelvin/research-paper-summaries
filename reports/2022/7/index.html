          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular electronic spectra can be represented in the time domain as
auto-correlation functions of the initial vibrational wavepacket. We present a
derivation of the harmonic vibrational auto-correlation function that is valid
for both real and imaginary harmonic frequencies. The derivation rests on Lie
algebra techniques that map otherwise complicated exponential operator
arithmetic to simpler matrix formulae. The expressions for the zero- and
finite-temperature harmonic auto-correlation functions have been carefully
structured both to be free of branch-cut discontinuities and to remain
numerically stable with finite-precision arithmetic. Simple extensions correct
the harmonic Franck-Condon approximation for the lowest-order anharmonic and
Herzberg-Teller effects. Quantitative simulations are shown for several
examples, including the electronic absorption spectra of F$_2$, HOCl, CH$_2$NH,
and NO$_2$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present e3nn, a generalized framework for creating E(3) equivariant
trainable functions, also known as Euclidean neural networks. e3nn naturally
operates on geometry and geometric tensors that describe systems in 3D and
transform predictably under a change of coordinate system. The core of e3nn are
equivariant operations such as the TensorProduct class or the spherical
harmonics functions that can be composed to create more complex modules such as
convolutions and attention mechanisms. These core operations of e3nn can be
used to efficiently articulate Tensor Field Networks, 3D Steerable CNNs,
Clebsch-Gordan Networks, SE(3) Transformers and other E(3) equivariant

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A key yet unresolved question in modern-day astronomy is how galaxies formed
and evolved under the paradigm of the $\Lambda$CDM model. A critical limiting
factor lies in the lack of robust tools to describe the merger history through
a statistical model. In this work, we employ a generative graph network, E(n)
Equivariant Graph Normalizing Flows Model. We demonstrate that, by treating the
progenitors as a graph, our model robustly recovers their distributions,
including their masses, merging redshifts and pairwise distances at redshift
z=2 conditioned on their z=0 properties. The generative nature of the model
enables other downstream tasks, including likelihood-free inference, detecting
anomalies and identifying subtle correlations of progenitor features.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the "planes of satellite galaxies" problem, which refers to the observation that satellite galaxies in the Local Group are not randomly distributed around their host galaxy, but rather form a plane or disk-like structure. The authors propose solutions and open questions related to this phenomenon.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, previous studies have suggested various solutions to the "planes of satellite galaxies" problem, such as hierarchical clustering or tidal interactions. However, these solutions have limitations and do not fully explain the observed behavior. The current paper proposes a new approach based on equivariant graph normalizing flows, which can capture the symmetries of the problem more effectively.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to test their proposed solution using simulations. They create mock datasets with different satellite distributions and apply their method to infer the properties of the satellites. They also compare their results with observations from the real universe.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide visual representations of the satellite distribution problem and the authors' proposed solution. Table 2 is also mentioned frequently, as it presents the results of their experiments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an experimental instrument that performs laboratory-based
gas-phase Terahertz Desorption Emission Spectroscopy (THz-DES) experiments in
support of astrochemistry. The measurement system combines a terahertz
heterodyne radiometer that uses room temperature semiconductor mixer diode
technology previously developed for the purposes of Earth observation, with a
high-vacuum desorption gas cell and high-speed digital sampling circuitry to
enable high spectral and temporal resolution spectroscopy of molecular species
with thermal discrimination. During use, molecules are condensed onto a liquid
nitrogen cooled metal finger to emulate ice structures that may be present in
space. Following deposition, thermal desorption is controlled and initiated by
means of a heater and monitored via a temperature sensor. The 'rest frequency'
spectral signatures of molecules released into the vacuum cell environment are
detected by the heterodyne radiometer in real-time and characterised with high
spectral resolution. To demonstrate the viability of the instrument, we have
studied Nitrous Oxide (N2O). This molecule strongly emits within the terahertz
(sub-millimetre wavelength) range and provide a suitable test gas and we
compare the results obtained with more traditional techniques such as
quadrupole mass spectrometry. The results obtained allow us to fully
characterize the measurement method and we discuss its potential use as a
laboratory tool in support of astrochemical observations of molecular species
in the interstellar medium and the Solar System.</p>

          <p>The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's
needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's
reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It
is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our
planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic
disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of
different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the
range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding
reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one
or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons.
These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to
tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The
availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it
is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics.
Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic
disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying
astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some
transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and
should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>To satisfy rising energy needs and to handle the forthcoming worldwide
climate transformation, major research attention has been drawn to
environmentally friendly, renewable, and abundant energy resources. Hydrogen
plays an ideal and significant role is such resources, due to its
non-carbon-based energy and production through clean energy. In this work, we
have explored the catalytic activity of a newly predicted haeckelite boron
nitride quantum dot (haeck-BNQD), constructed from the infinite BN sheet, for
its utilization in hydrogen production. Density functional theory calculations
are employed to investigate geometry optimization, electronic and adsorption
mechanism of haeck-BNQD using Gaussian16 package, employing the hybrid B3LYP
and wB97XD functionals, along with 6- 31G(d,p) basis set. A number of physical
quantities such as HOMO/LUMO energies, the density of states, hydrogen atom
adsorption energies, Mulliken populations, Gibbs free energy, work functions,
overpotentials, etc., have been computed and analyzed in the context of the
catalytic performance of haeck-BNQD for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER).
Based on our calculations, we predict that the best catalytic performance will
be obtained for H adsorption on top of the squares or the octagons of
haeck-BNQD. We hope that our prediction of the most active catalytic sites on
haeck-BNQD for HER will be put to test in future experiments.</p>
