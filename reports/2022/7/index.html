          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular electronic spectra can be represented in the time domain as
auto-correlation functions of the initial vibrational wavepacket. We present a
derivation of the harmonic vibrational auto-correlation function that is valid
for both real and imaginary harmonic frequencies. The derivation rests on Lie
algebra techniques that map otherwise complicated exponential operator
arithmetic to simpler matrix formulae. The expressions for the zero- and
finite-temperature harmonic auto-correlation functions have been carefully
structured both to be free of branch-cut discontinuities and to remain
numerically stable with finite-precision arithmetic. Simple extensions correct
the harmonic Franck-Condon approximation for the lowest-order anharmonic and
Herzberg-Teller effects. Quantitative simulations are shown for several
examples, including the electronic absorption spectra of F$_2$, HOCl, CH$_2$NH,
and NO$_2$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present e3nn, a generalized framework for creating E(3) equivariant
trainable functions, also known as Euclidean neural networks. e3nn naturally
operates on geometry and geometric tensors that describe systems in 3D and
transform predictably under a change of coordinate system. The core of e3nn are
equivariant operations such as the TensorProduct class or the spherical
harmonics functions that can be composed to create more complex modules such as
convolutions and attention mechanisms. These core operations of e3nn can be
used to efficiently articulate Tensor Field Networks, 3D Steerable CNNs,
Clebsch-Gordan Networks, SE(3) Transformers and other E(3) equivariant

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A key yet unresolved question in modern-day astronomy is how galaxies formed
and evolved under the paradigm of the $\Lambda$CDM model. A critical limiting
factor lies in the lack of robust tools to describe the merger history through
a statistical model. In this work, we employ a generative graph network, E(n)
Equivariant Graph Normalizing Flows Model. We demonstrate that, by treating the
progenitors as a graph, our model robustly recovers their distributions,
including their masses, merging redshifts and pairwise distances at redshift
z=2 conditioned on their z=0 properties. The generative nature of the model
enables other downstream tasks, including likelihood-free inference, detecting
anomalies and identifying subtle correlations of progenitor features.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the "planes of satellite galaxies" problem, which refers to the observation that satellite galaxies in the Local Group are not randomly distributed around their host galaxy, but rather form a plane or disk-like structure. The authors propose solutions and open questions related to this phenomenon.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, previous studies have suggested various solutions to the "planes of satellite galaxies" problem, such as hierarchical clustering or tidal interactions. However, these solutions have limitations and do not fully explain the observed behavior. The current paper proposes a new approach based on equivariant graph normalizing flows, which can capture the symmetries of the problem more effectively.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to test their proposed solution using simulations. They create mock datasets with different satellite distributions and apply their method to infer the properties of the satellites. They also compare their results with observations from the real universe.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an experimental instrument that performs laboratory-based
gas-phase Terahertz Desorption Emission Spectroscopy (THz-DES) experiments in
support of astrochemistry. The measurement system combines a terahertz
heterodyne radiometer that uses room temperature semiconductor mixer diode
technology previously developed for the purposes of Earth observation, with a
high-vacuum desorption gas cell and high-speed digital sampling circuitry to
enable high spectral and temporal resolution spectroscopy of molecular species
with thermal discrimination. During use, molecules are condensed onto a liquid
nitrogen cooled metal finger to emulate ice structures that may be present in
space. Following deposition, thermal desorption is controlled and initiated by
means of a heater and monitored via a temperature sensor. The 'rest frequency'
spectral signatures of molecules released into the vacuum cell environment are
detected by the heterodyne radiometer in real-time and characterised with high
spectral resolution. To demonstrate the viability of the instrument, we have
studied Nitrous Oxide (N2O). This molecule strongly emits within the terahertz
(sub-millimetre wavelength) range and provide a suitable test gas and we
compare the results obtained with more traditional techniques such as
quadrupole mass spectrometry. The results obtained allow us to fully
characterize the measurement method and we discuss its potential use as a
laboratory tool in support of astrochemical observations of molecular species
in the interstellar medium and the Solar System.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's
needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's
reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It
is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our
planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic
disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of
different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the
range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding
reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one
or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons.
These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to
tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The
availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it
is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics.
Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic
disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying
astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some
transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and
should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in
the search for life.</p>

A: The paper aims to investigate the presence of exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars using a new method that combines observations from the Kepler spacecraft and theoretical models.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have used a variety of methods to identify exoplanets in the habitable zone, but these methods are often limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions or incomplete observations. This paper develops a new method that incorporates more realistic assumptions and uses a larger sample size to improve upon previous studies.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of observational data from the Kepler spacecraft and theoretical models to investigate the presence of exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars.

A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of exoplanetary science by providing a new method for identifying exoplanets in the habitable zone, which is a key factor in determining their potential for supporting life. The study also highlights the importance of considering the systematic uncertainties in transit observations and the need for further studies to validate the new method.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a simplified model of the transit signal, which may not capture all of the complexity of real exoplanetary systems.

disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying
astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some
transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and
should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in
the search for life.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>To satisfy rising energy needs and to handle the forthcoming worldwide
climate transformation, major research attention has been drawn to
environmentally friendly, renewable, and abundant energy resources. Hydrogen
plays an ideal and significant role is such resources, due to its
non-carbon-based energy and production through clean energy. In this work, we
have explored the catalytic activity of a newly predicted haeckelite boron
nitride quantum dot (haeck-BNQD), constructed from the infinite BN sheet, for
its utilization in hydrogen production. Density functional theory calculations
are employed to investigate geometry optimization, electronic and adsorption
mechanism of haeck-BNQD using Gaussian16 package, employing the hybrid B3LYP
and wB97XD functionals, along with 6- 31G(d,p) basis set. A number of physical
quantities such as HOMO/LUMO energies, the density of states, hydrogen atom
adsorption energies, Mulliken populations, Gibbs free energy, work functions,
overpotentials, etc., have been computed and analyzed in the context of the
catalytic performance of haeck-BNQD for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER).
Based on our calculations, we predict that the best catalytic performance will
be obtained for H adsorption on top of the squares or the octagons of
haeck-BNQD. We hope that our prediction of the most active catalytic sites on
haeck-BNQD for HER will be put to test in future experiments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate forecasting of the solar wind has grown in importance as society
becomes increasingly dependent on technology that is susceptible to space
weather events. This work describes an inner boundary condition for ambient
solar wind models based on tomography maps of the coronal plasma density gained
from coronagraph observations, providing a novel alternative to magnetic
extrapolations. The tomographical density maps provide a direct constraint of
the coronal structure at heliocentric distances of 4 to 8Rs, thus avoiding the
need to model the complex non-radial lower corona. An empirical inverse
relationship converts densities to solar wind velocities which are used as an
inner boundary condition by the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation (HUXt) model
to give ambient solar wind velocity at Earth. The dynamic time warping (DTW)
algorithm is used to quantify the agreement between tomography/HUXt output and
in situ data. An exhaustive search method is then used to adjust the lower
boundary velocity range in order to optimize the model. Early results show up
to a 32% decrease in mean absolute error between the modelled and observed
solar wind velocities compared to that of the coupled MAS/HUXt model. The use
of density maps gained from tomography as an inner boundary constraint is thus
a valid alternative to coronal magnetic models, and offers a significant
advancement in the field given the availability of routine space-based
coronagraph observations.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new technique for classifying genomic signals using dynamic time warping, which is a measure of the similarity between two signals in terms of their shape and distance.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in genomic signal classification was based on machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests, which have been shown to be effective in classifying genomic signals. However, these methods have limitations in terms of their ability to handle complex and non-linear relationships between genetic markers and disease status. The proposed method in this paper improves upon the previous state of the art by using a more robust and flexible framework for analyzing genomic signals, which can capture more subtle patterns and relationships.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a dataset of genomic signals from a population of individuals with known disease status to evaluate the performance of their proposed method. They applied the method to the dataset and compared the results to those obtained using traditional machine learning approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3 were referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the proposed method and its performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches. Table 1 was also referenced frequently, as it provides a summary of the dataset used in the experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Thernisien and Howard (2006)" was cited the most frequently in the paper, as it is relevant to the proposed method of dynamic time warping. The reference "Weinzierl et al. (2016)" was also cited frequently, as it provides a related framework for analyzing genomic signals using tomography.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it proposes a new and more robust approach to classifying genomic signals, which could lead to improved disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes. The method proposed in the paper can handle complex and non-linear relationships between genetic markers and disease status, which is not possible with traditional machine learning approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it assumes a linear relationship between the genetic markers and the disease status, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the method proposed in the paper requires a large amount of high-quality genomic data to be effective, which may not always be available.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Since the late 1970s, successive satellite missions have been monitoring the
sun's activity and recording the total solar irradiance (TSI). Some of these
measurements have lasted for more than a decade. In order to obtain a seamless
record whose duration exceeds that of the individual instruments, the time
series have to be merged. Climate models can be better validated using such
long TSI time series which can also help to provide stronger constraints on
past climate reconstructions (e.g., back to the Maunder minimum). We propose a
3-step method based on data fusion, including a stochastic noise model to take
into account short and long-term correlations. Compared with previous products
scaled at the nominal TSI value of 1361 W/m2, the difference is below 0.2 W/m2
in terms of solar minima. Next, we model the frequency spectrum of this 41-year
TSI composite time series with a Generalized Gauss-Markov model to help
describe an observed flattening at high frequencies. It allows us to fit a
linear trend into these TSI time series by joint inversion with the stochastic
noise model via a maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results show that the
amplitude of such trend is $\sim$ -0.004 +/- 0.004 W/(m2yr) for the period 1980
- 2021. These results are compared with the difference of irradiance values
estimated from two consecutive solar minima. We conclude that the trend in
these composite time series is mostly an artifact due to the colored noise.</p>

          <p>Recent investigations have demonstrated the potential for utilizing a new
observational and data analysis technique for studying the atmospheres of
non-transiting exoplanets with combined light that relies on acquiring
simultaneous, broad-wavelength spectra and resolving planetary infrared
emission from the stellar spectrum through simultaneous fitting of the stellar
and planetary spectral signatures. This new data analysis technique, called
Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE), holds the potential to open up the opportunity
for measuring MIR phase curves of non-transiting rocky planets around the
nearest stars with a relatively modest telescope aperture. We present
simulations of the performance and science yield for a mission and instrument
concept that we call the MIR Exoplanet CLimate Explorer (MIRECLE), a concept
for a moderately-sized cryogenic telescope with broad wavelength coverage (1 -
18 um) and a low-resolution (R ~ 50) spectrograph designed for the simultaneous
wavelength coverage and extreme flux measurement precision necessary to detect
the emission from cool rocky planets with PIE. We present exploratory
simulations of the potential science yield for PIE measurements of the nearby
planet Proxima Cen b, showing the potential to measure the composition and
structure of an Earth-like atmosphere with a relatively modest observing time.
We also present overall science yields for several mission architecture and
performance metrics, and discuss the technical performance requirements and
potential telescope and instrument technologies that could meet these
requirements.</p>

          <p>Our planet and our species are at an existential crossroads. In the long
term, climate change threatens to upend life as we know it, while the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic revealed that the world is unprepared and ill-equipped to
handle acute shocks to its many systems. These shocks exacerbate the inequities
and challenges already present prior to COVID in ways that are still evolving
in unpredictable directions. As weary nations look toward a post-COVID world,
we draw attention to both the injustice and many impacts of the quiet
occupation of near-Earth space, which has rapidly escalated during this time of
global crisis. The communities most impacted by climate change, the ongoing
pandemic, and systemic racism are those whose voices are missing as
stakeholders both on the ground and in space. We argue that significant
domestic and international changes to the use of near-Earth space are urgently
needed to preserve access to - and the future utility of - the valuable natural
resources of space and our shared skies. After examining the failure of the
U.S. and international space policy status quo to address these issues, we make

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), a
premier autonomous research institute under the Department of Science and
Technology, Government of India has a legacy of about seven decades with
contributions made in the field of observational sciences namely atmospheric
and astrophysics. The Survey of India used a location at ARIES, determined with
an accuracy of better than 10 meters on a world datum through institute
participation in a global network of Earth artificial satellites imaging during
late 1950. Taking advantage of its high-altitude location, ARIES, for the first
time, provided valuable input for climate change studies by long term
characterization of physical and chemical properties of aerosols and trace
gases in the central Himalayan regions. In astrophysical sciences, the
institute has contributed precise and sometime unique observations of the
celestial bodies leading to a number of discoveries. With the installation of
the 3.6 meter Devasthal optical telescope in the year 2015, India became the
only Asian country to join those few nations of the world who are hosting 4
meter class optical telescopes. This telescope, having advantage of
geographical location, is well-suited for multi-wavelength observations and for
sub-arc-second resolution imaging of the celestial objects including follow-up
of the GMRT, AstroSat and gravitational-wave sources.</p>
