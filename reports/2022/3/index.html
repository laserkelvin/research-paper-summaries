          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Physical theories grounded in mathematical symmetries are an essential
component of our understanding of a wide range of properties of the universe.
Similarly, in the domain of machine learning, an awareness of symmetries such
as rotation or permutation invariance has driven impressive performance
breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and other
important applications. In this report, we argue that both the physics
community and the broader machine learning community have much to understand
and potentially to gain from a deeper investment in research concerning
symmetry group equivariant machine learning architectures. For some
applications, the introduction of symmetries into the fundamental structural
design can yield models that are more economical (i.e. contain fewer, but more
expressive, learned parameters), interpretable (i.e. more explainable or
directly mappable to physical quantities), and/or trainable (i.e. more
efficient in both data and computational requirements). We discuss various
figures of merit for evaluating these models as well as some potential benefits
and limitations of these methods for a variety of physics applications.
Research and investment into these approaches will lay the foundation for
future architectures that are potentially more robust under new computational
paradigms and will provide a richer description of the physical systems to
which they are applied.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling atomic
simulations has the potential to revolutionize catalyst discovery, which is a
key step in making progress towards the energy breakthroughs needed to combat
climate change. However, the GNNs that have proven most effective for this task
are memory intensive as they model higher-order interactions in the graphs such
as those between triplets or quadruplets of atoms, making it challenging to
scale these models. In this paper, we introduce Graph Parallelism, a method to
distribute input graphs across multiple GPUs, enabling us to train very large
GNNs with hundreds of millions or billions of parameters. We empirically
evaluate our method by scaling up the number of parameters of the recently
proposed DimeNet++ and GemNet models by over an order of magnitude. On the
large-scale Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset, these graph-parallelized models
lead to relative improvements of 1) 15% on the force MAE metric for the S2EF
task and 2) 21% on the AFbT metric for the IS2RS task, establishing new
state-of-the-art results.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Quantifying the level of atomic disorder within materials is critical to
understanding how evolving local structural environments dictate performance
and durability. Here, we leverage graph neural networks to define a physically
interpretable metric for local disorder. This metric encodes the diversity of
the local atomic configurations as a continuous spectrum between the solid and
liquid phases, quantified against a distribution of thermal perturbations. We
apply this novel methodology to three prototypical examples with varying levels
of disorder: (1) solid-liquid interfaces, (2) polycrystalline microstructures,
and (3) grain boundaries. Using elemental aluminum as a case study, we show how
our paradigm can track the spatio-temporal evolution of interfaces,
incorporating a mathematically defined description of the spatial boundary
between order and disorder. We further show how to extract physics-preserved
gradients from our continuous disorder fields, which may be used to understand
and predict materials performance and failure. Overall, our framework provides
an intuitive and generalizable pathway to quantify the relationship between
complex local atomic structure and coarse-grained materials phenomena.</p>

However, these models were limited by their reliance on handcrafted features and their inability to effectively capture the spatial structure of molecules. In contrast, the proposed message passing scheme in this paper leverages the spatial structure of molecules to improve the performance of GCNNs.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the theories for the origin of life proposes that a significant
fraction of prebiotic material could have arrived to Earth from outer space
between 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago. This suggests that those prebiotic
compounds could have originated in interstellar space, to be later on
incorporated to small Solar-system bodies and planetesimals. The recent
discovery of prebiotic molecules such as hydroxylamine and ethanolamine in the
interstellar medium, strongly supports this hypothesis. However, some species
such as sugars, key for the synthesis of ribonucleotides and for metabolic
processes, remain to be discovered in space. The unmatched sensitivity of the
Square Kilometer Array (SKA) at centimeter wavelengths will be able to detect
even more complex and heavier prebiotic molecules than existing
instrumentation. In this contribution, we illustrate the potential of the SKA
to detect simple sugars with three and four carbon atoms, using a moderate
investment of observing time.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The astrochemistry of CO2 ice analogues has been a topic of intensive
investigation due to the prevalence of CO2 throughout the interstellar medium
and the Solar System, as well as the possibility of it acting as a carbon
feedstock for the synthesis of larger, more complex organic molecules. In order
to accurately discern the physico-chemical processes in which CO2 plays a role,
it is necessary to have laboratory-generated spectra to compare against
observational data acquired by ground- and space-based telescopes. A key factor
which is known to influence the appearance of such spectra is temperature,
especially when the spectra are acquired in the infrared and ultraviolet. In
this present study, we describe the results of a systematic investigation
looking into: (i) the influence of thermal annealing on the mid-IR and VUV
absorption spectra of pure, unirradiated CO2 astrophysical ice analogues
prepared at various temperatures, and (ii) the influence of temperature on the
chemical products of electron irradiation of similar ices. Our results indicate
that both mid-IR and VUV spectra of pure CO2 ices are sensitive to the
structural and chemical changes induced by thermal annealing. Furthermore,
using mid-IR spectroscopy, we have successfully identified the production of
radiolytic daughter molecules as a result of 1 keV electron irradiation and the
influence of temperature over this chemistry. Such results are directly
applicable to studies on the chemistry of interstellar ices, comets, and icy
lunar objects and may also be useful as reference data for forthcoming
observational missions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Despite the recent progress in quantum computational algorithms for
chemistry, there is a dearth of quantum computational simulations focused on
material science applications, especially for the energy sector, where next
generation sorbing materials are urgently needed to battle climate change. To
drive their development, quantum computing is applied to the problem of CO$_2$
adsorption in Al-fumarate Metal-Organic Frameworks. Fragmentation strategies
based on Density Matrix Embedding Theory are applied, using a variational
quantum algorithm as a fragment solver, along with active space selection to
minimise qubit number. By investigating different fragmentation strategies and
solvers, we propose a methodology to apply quantum computing to Al-fumarate
interacting with a CO$_2$ molecule, demonstrating the feasibility of treating a
complex porous system as a concrete application of quantum computing. Our work
paves the way for the use of quantum computing techniques in the quest of
sorbents optimisation for more efficient carbon capture and conversion
applications.</p>
