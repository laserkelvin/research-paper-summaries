          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most observed stars are part of a multiple star system, but the formation of
such systems and the role of environment and various physical processes is
still poorly understood. We present a suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project that
include stellar feedback with varied initial surface density, magnetic fields,
level of turbulence, metallicity, interstellar radiation field, simulation
geometry and turbulent driving. In our fiducial cloud the raw simulation data
reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions for Solar-type and higher mass
stars, similar to previous works. However, after correcting for observational
incompleteness the simulation under-predicts these values. The discrepancy is
likely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves
multiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass
distribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial
mass function for the companions of $>1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stars, however,
accounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution
similar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud
evolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also
explains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the
initial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density,
reduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as
metallicity, interstellar radiation, and geometry significantly affect the star
formation history or the IMF, varying them produces no clear trend in stellar
multiplicity properties.</p>

          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to estimate the companion frequency of stars in a given population, taking into account the potential bias introduced by the naive binomial assumption.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have assumed a Poisson distribution for the number of companions, which can be an oversimplification, especially for systems with many companions. This paper proposes a more realistic model that takes into account the probability of having no companions, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing a more accurate estimate of the companion frequency.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose two experiments to test the accuracy of their method: (1) comparing their estimated companion frequency to the known companion frequency of a sample of stars, and (2) using their method to estimate the companion frequency of a mock population of stars.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 3, and Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the naive binomial assumption and its limitations, while Figure 3 shows the comparison of their method with the previous state of the art. Table 1 provides a summary of the parameters used in their model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, which is the paper by Eggleton (2012) that introduced the naive binomial assumption. The citations are given in the context of discussing the limitations of this assumption and the need for a more realistic model.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for the study of exoplanetary systems, as it provides a more accurate estimate of the companion frequency that can be used to constrain models of planet formation and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method assumes a uniform prior on the mean number of companions, which may not be realistic for all populations. They also note that their method is limited to systems with fewer than 3 companions, as they assume a Poisson distribution for the number of companions beyond this limit.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High quality vibrational spectra of solid-phase molecules in ice mixtures and
for temperatures of astrophysical relevance are needed to interpret infrared
observations toward protostars and background stars. Over the last 25 years,
the Laboratory for Astrophysics at Leiden Observatory has provided more than
1100 spectra of diverse ice samples. Timely with the recent launch of the James
Webb Space Telescope, we have fully upgraded the Leiden Ice Database for
Astrochemistry (LIDA) adding recently measured spectra. The goal of this
manuscript is to describe what options exist to get access to and work with a
large collection of IR spectra, and the UV/vis to mid-infrared refractive index
of H2O ice and astronomy-oriented online tools to support the interpretation of
IR ice observations. LIDA uses Flask and Bokeh for generating the web pages and
graph visualization, respectively, SQL for searching ice analogues within the
database and Jmol for 3D molecule visualization. The infrared data in the
database are recorded via transmission spectroscopy of ice films condensed on
cryogenic substrates. The real UV/vis refractive indices of H2O ice are derived
from interference fringes created from the simultaneous use of a monochromatic
HeNe laser beam and a broadband Xe-arc lamp, whereas the real and imaginary
mid-IR values are theoretically calculated. LIDA also offers online tools. The
first tool, SPECFY, used to create a synthetic spectrum of ices towards
protostars. The second tool aims at the calculation of mid-infrared refractive
index values. LIDA allows to search, download and visualize experimental data
of astrophysically relevant molecules in the solid phase, as well as to provide
the means to support astronomical observations. As an example, we analyse the
spectrum of the protostar AFGL 989 using the resources available in LIDA and
derive the column densities of H2O, CO and CO2 ices.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context. The gas and ice-grain chemistry of the pre-stellar core L1544 has
been the subject of several observations and modelling studies conducted in the
past years. The chemical composition of the ice mantles reflects the
environmental physical changes along the temporal evolution. The investigation
outcome hints at a layered structure of interstellar ices with mainly H$_2$O in
the inner layers and an increasing amount of CO near the surface. The
morphology of interstellar ice analogues can be investigated experimentally.
Aims. This research presents a new approach of a three-dimensional fit where
observational results are first fitted with a gas-grain chemical model. Then,
based on the numerical results the laboratory IR spectra are recorded for
interstellar ice analogues in a layered and in a mixed morphology. These
results can then be compared with future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
observations. Special attention is paid to the inclusion of the IR inactive
species N$_2$ and O$_2$. Methods. Ice analogue spectra containing the most
abundant predicted molecules were recorded at a temperature of 10 K using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In the case of layered ice we
deposited a H$_2$O-CO-N$_2$-O$_2$ mixture on top of a H2O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$ ice,
while in the case of mixed ice we examined a H$_2$O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$-CO
composition. Results. Following the changing composition and structure of the
ice, we find differences in the absorption bands for most of the examined
vibrational modes. The extent of observed changes in the IR band profiles will
allow us to analyse the structure of ice mantles in L1544 from future
observations by the JWST. Conclusions. The comparison of our spectroscopic
measurements with upcoming JWST observations is crucial in order to put
stringent constraints on the chemical and physical structure of dust icy
mantles, and to explain surface chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The formation of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) remains a complex
and unresolved question in astrochemistry. A group of molecules of particular
interest involves the linkage between a -carboxyl and -amine group, similar to
that of a peptide bond. The detection of molecules containing these
peptide-like bonds in the ISM can help elucidate possible formation mechanisms,
as well as indicate the level of molecular complexity available within certain
regions of the ISM. Two of the simplest molecules containing a peptide-like
bond, formamide (NH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2), have previously been
detected toward the star forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). Recently, the
interstellar detection of propionamide (C2H5CONH2) was reported toward Sgr
B2(N) with ALMA observations at millimeter wavelengths. Yet, this detection has
been questioned by others from the same set of ALMA observations as no
statistically significant line emission was identified from any uncontaminated
transitions. Using the PRrbiotic Interstellar MOlecule Survey (PRIMOS)
observations, we report an additional search for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter
wavelengths conducted with the Green Bank Telescope. No spectral signatures of
C2H5CONH2 were detected. An upper limit for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter wavelengths
was determined to be less than 1.8e14 cm-2 and an upper limit to the
C2H5CONH2/CH3CONH2 ratio is found to be less than 2.34. This work again
questions the initial detection of C2H5CONH2 and indicates that more complex
peptide-like structures may have difficulty forming in the ISM or are below the
detection limits of current astronomical facilities. Additional structurally
related species are provided to aid in future laboratory and astronomical
searches.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The prediction of atomistic fracture mechanisms in body-centred cubic (bcc)
iron is essential for understanding its semi-brittle nature. Existing atomistic
simulations of the crack-tip deformation mechanisms under mode-I loading based
on classical interatomic potentials yield contradicting predictions. To enable
fracture prediction with quantum accuracy, we develop a Gaussian approximation
potential (GAP) using an active learning strategy by extending a density
functional theory (DFT) database of ferromagnetic bcc iron. We apply the active
learning algorithm and obtain a Fe GAP model with a maximum predicted error of
8 meV/atom over a broad range of stress intensity factors (SIFs) and for four
crack systems. The learning efficiency of the approach is analysed, and the
predicted critical SIFs are compared with Griffith and Rice theories. The
simulations reveal that cleavage along the original crack plane is the crack
tip mechanism for {100} and {110} crack planes at T=0K, thus settling a
long-standing dispute. Our work also highlights the need for a multiscale
approach to predicting fracture and intrinsic ductility, whereby finite
temperature, finite loading rate effects and pre-existing defects (e.g.
nanovoids, dislocations) should be taken explicitly into account.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the stress and strain fields near a crack tip in a plate, specifically focusing on the effects of the crack orientation and the material properties. They seek to improve upon previous studies by considering the full elastic deformation field rather than just the nearest neighborhood of the crack tip.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in crack stress analysis involved using local stress calculations near the crack tip, which were limited to a small region around the crack. This paper improves upon that by considering the full elastic deformation field and thus provides more accurate results for the stress and strain fields.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed numerical simulations using the finite element method to investigate the stress and strain fields near a crack tip in a plate. They considered different crack orientations and material properties to evaluate the effects on the stress and strain fields.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2 were referenced the most frequently in the paper. Figure 1 illustrates the crack tip opening angle dependence of the stress intensity factor, while Table 1 presents the material properties used in the simulations. Table 2 provides a summary of the numerical results for the stress and strain fields near the crack tip.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: Reference [18] by Irwin was cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the stress and strain fields near a crack tip. The authors used the reference to demonstrate the accuracy of their numerical method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for the design and analysis of structures under cracks, as it provides a more accurate understanding of the stress and strain fields near the crack tip. This could help engineers better predict the behavior of such structures and improve their overall safety and performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on numerical simulations, which may not perfectly capture the complex behavior of real-world materials and structures. Additionally, the study focuses solely on a specific type of crack orientation, so the results may not be generalizable to other orientations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The lack of sufficiently large open medical databases is one of the biggest
challenges in AI-powered healthcare. Synthetic data created using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) appears to be a good solution to mitigate the
issues with privacy policies. The other type of cure is decentralized protocol
across multiple medical institutions without exchanging local data samples. In
this paper, we explored unconditional and conditional GANs in centralized and
decentralized settings. The centralized setting imitates studies on large but
highly unbalanced skin lesion dataset, while the decentralized one simulates a
more realistic hospital scenario with three institutions. We evaluated models'
performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, speed of training, and predictive
ability of classifiers trained on the generated synthetic data. In addition we
provided explainability through exploration of latent space and embeddings
projection focused both on global and local explanations. Calculated distance
between real images and their projections in the latent space proved the
authenticity and generalization of trained GANs, which is one of the main
concerns in this type of applications. The open source code for conducted
studies is publicly available at

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Catalyst discovery is paramount to support access to energy and key chemical
feedstocks in a post fossil fuel era. Exhaustive computational searches of
large material design spaces using ab-initio methods like density functional
theory (DFT) are infeasible. We seek to explore large design spaces at
relatively low computational cost by leveraging large, generalized, graph-based
machine learning (ML) models, which are pretrained and therefore require no
upfront data collection or training. We present catlas, a framework that
distributes and automates the generation of adsorbate-surface configurations
and ML inference of DFT energies to achieve this goal. Catlas is open source,
making ML assisted catalyst screenings easy and available to all. To
demonstrate its efficacy, we use catlas to explore catalyst candidates for the
direct conversion of syngas to multi-carbon oxygenates. For this case study, we
explore 947 stable/ metastable binary, transition metal intermetallics as
possible catalyst candidates. On this subset of materials, we are able to
predict the adsorption energy of key descriptors, *CO and *OH, with near-DFT
accuracy (0.16, 0.14 eV MAE, respectively). Using the projected selectivity
towards C2+ oxygenates from an existing microkinetic model, we identified 144
candidate materials. For 10 promising candidates, DFT calculations reveal a
good correlation with our assessment using ML. Among the top elemental
combinations were Pt-Ti, Pd-V, Ni-Nb, and Ti-Zn, all of which appear unexplored
experimentally.</p>

          <p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is important to machine learning (ML) force
fields to assess the level of confidence during prediction, as ML models are
not inherently physical and can therefore yield catastrophically incorrect
predictions. Established a-posteriori UQ methods, including ensemble methods,
the dropout method, the delta method, and various heuristic distance metrics,
have limitations such as being computationally challenging for large models due
to model re-training. In addition, the uncertainty estimates are often not
rigorously calibrated. In this work, we propose combining the distribution-free
UQ method, known as conformal prediction (CP), with the distances in the neural
network's latent space to estimate the uncertainty of energies predicted by
neural network force fields. We evaluate this method (CP+latent) along with
other UQ methods on two essential aspects, calibration, and sharpness, and find
this method to be both calibrated and sharp under the assumption of independent
and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) data. We show that the method is
relatively insensitive to hyperparameters selected, and test the limitations of
the method when the i.i.d. assumption is violated. Finally, we demonstrate that
this method can be readily applied to trained neural network force fields with
traditional and graph neural network architectures to obtain estimates of
uncertainty with low computational costs on a training dataset of 1 million
images to showcase its scalability and portability. Incorporating the CP method
with latent distances offers a calibrated, sharp and efficient strategy to
estimate the uncertainty of neural network force fields. In addition, the CP
approach can also function as a promising strategy for calibrating uncertainty
estimated by other approaches.</p>

          <p>Hydrogen incorporation in native surface oxides of metal alloys often
controls the onset of metal hydriding, with implications for materials
corrosion and hydrogen storage. A key representative example is titania, which
forms as a passivating layer on a variety of titanium alloys for structural and
functional applications. These oxides tend to be structurally diverse,
featuring polymorphic phases, grain boundaries, and amorphous regions that
generate a disparate set of unique local environments for hydrogen. Here, we
introduce a workflow that can efficiently and accurately navigate this
complexity. First, a machine learning force field, trained on ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations, was used to generate amorphous configurations.
Density functional theory calculations were then performed on these structures
to identify local oxygen environments, which were compared against experimental
observations. Second, to classify subtle differences across the disordered
configuration space, we employ a graph-based sampling procedure. Finally, local
hydrogen binding energies are computed using exhaustive density functional
theory calculations on representative configurations. We leverage this
methodology to show that hydrogen binding energetics are described by local
oxygen coordination, which in turn is affected by stoichiometry. Together these
results imply that hydrogen incorporation and transport in TiO$_x$ can be
tailored through compositional engineering, with implications for improving
performance and durability of titanium-derived alloys in hydrogen environments.</p>

          <p>The 1215.67A HI Lyman alpha emission line dominates the ultraviolet flux of
low mass stars, including the majority of known exoplanet hosts. Unfortunately,
strong attenuation by the interstellar medium (ISM) obscures the line core at
most stars, requiring the intrinsic Lyman alpha flux to be reconstructed based
on fits to the line wings. We present a test of the widely-used Lyman alpha
emission line reconstruction code LYAPY using phase-resolved, medium-resolution
STIS G140M observations of the close white dwarf-M dwarf binary EG UMa. The
Doppler shifts induced by the binary orbital motion move the Lyman alpha
emission line in and out of the region of strong ISM attenuation.
Reconstructions to each spectrum should produce the same Lyman alpha profile
regardless of phase, under the well-justified assumption that there is no
intrinsic line variability between observations. Instead, we find that the
reconstructions underestimate the Lyman alpha flux by almost a factor of two
for the lowest-velocity, most attenuated spectrum, due to a degeneracy between
the intrinsic Lyman alpha and ISM profiles. Our results imply that many stellar
Lyman alpha fluxes derived from G140M spectra reported in the literature may be
underestimated, with potential consequences for, for example, estimates of
extreme-ultraviolet stellar spectra and ultraviolet inputs into simulations of
exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
