          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most observed stars are part of a multiple star system, but the formation of
such systems and the role of environment and various physical processes is
still poorly understood. We present a suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project that
include stellar feedback with varied initial surface density, magnetic fields,
level of turbulence, metallicity, interstellar radiation field, simulation
geometry and turbulent driving. In our fiducial cloud the raw simulation data
reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions for Solar-type and higher mass
stars, similar to previous works. However, after correcting for observational
incompleteness the simulation under-predicts these values. The discrepancy is
likely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves
multiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass
distribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial
mass function for the companions of $>1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stars, however,
accounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution
similar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud
evolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also
explains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the
initial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density,
reduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as
metallicity, interstellar radiation, and geometry significantly affect the star
formation history or the IMF, varying them produces no clear trend in stellar
multiplicity properties.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to estimate the companion frequency of stars in a given population, taking into account the potential bias introduced by the naive binomial assumption.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have assumed a Poisson distribution for the number of companions, which can be an oversimplification, especially for systems with many companions. This paper proposes a more realistic model that takes into account the probability of having no companions, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing a more accurate estimate of the companion frequency.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose two experiments to test the accuracy of their method: (1) comparing their estimated companion frequency to the known companion frequency of a sample of stars, and (2) using their method to estimate the companion frequency of a mock population of stars.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 3, and Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the naive binomial assumption and its limitations, while Figure 3 shows the comparison of their method with the previous state of the art. Table 1 provides a summary of the parameters used in their model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, which is the paper by Eggleton (2012) that introduced the naive binomial assumption. The citations are given in the context of discussing the limitations of this assumption and the need for a more realistic model.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have significant implications for the study of exoplanetary systems, as it provides a more accurate estimate of the companion frequency that can be used to constrain models of planet formation and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method assumes a uniform prior on the mean number of companions, which may not be realistic for all populations. They also note that their method is limited to systems with fewer than 3 companions, as they assume a Poisson distribution for the number of companions beyond this limit.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High quality vibrational spectra of solid-phase molecules in ice mixtures and
for temperatures of astrophysical relevance are needed to interpret infrared
observations toward protostars and background stars. Over the last 25 years,
the Laboratory for Astrophysics at Leiden Observatory has provided more than
1100 spectra of diverse ice samples. Timely with the recent launch of the James
Webb Space Telescope, we have fully upgraded the Leiden Ice Database for
Astrochemistry (LIDA) adding recently measured spectra. The goal of this
manuscript is to describe what options exist to get access to and work with a
large collection of IR spectra, and the UV/vis to mid-infrared refractive index
of H2O ice and astronomy-oriented online tools to support the interpretation of
IR ice observations. LIDA uses Flask and Bokeh for generating the web pages and
graph visualization, respectively, SQL for searching ice analogues within the
database and Jmol for 3D molecule visualization. The infrared data in the
database are recorded via transmission spectroscopy of ice films condensed on
cryogenic substrates. The real UV/vis refractive indices of H2O ice are derived
from interference fringes created from the simultaneous use of a monochromatic
HeNe laser beam and a broadband Xe-arc lamp, whereas the real and imaginary
mid-IR values are theoretically calculated. LIDA also offers online tools. The
first tool, SPECFY, used to create a synthetic spectrum of ices towards
protostars. The second tool aims at the calculation of mid-infrared refractive
index values. LIDA allows to search, download and visualize experimental data
of astrophysically relevant molecules in the solid phase, as well as to provide
the means to support astronomical observations. As an example, we analyse the
spectrum of the protostar AFGL 989 using the resources available in LIDA and
derive the column densities of H2O, CO and CO2 ices.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context. The gas and ice-grain chemistry of the pre-stellar core L1544 has
been the subject of several observations and modelling studies conducted in the
past years. The chemical composition of the ice mantles reflects the
environmental physical changes along the temporal evolution. The investigation
outcome hints at a layered structure of interstellar ices with mainly H$_2$O in
the inner layers and an increasing amount of CO near the surface. The
morphology of interstellar ice analogues can be investigated experimentally.
Aims. This research presents a new approach of a three-dimensional fit where
observational results are first fitted with a gas-grain chemical model. Then,
based on the numerical results the laboratory IR spectra are recorded for
interstellar ice analogues in a layered and in a mixed morphology. These
results can then be compared with future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
observations. Special attention is paid to the inclusion of the IR inactive
species N$_2$ and O$_2$. Methods. Ice analogue spectra containing the most
abundant predicted molecules were recorded at a temperature of 10 K using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In the case of layered ice we
deposited a H$_2$O-CO-N$_2$-O$_2$ mixture on top of a H2O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$ ice,
while in the case of mixed ice we examined a H$_2$O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$-CO
composition. Results. Following the changing composition and structure of the
ice, we find differences in the absorption bands for most of the examined
vibrational modes. The extent of observed changes in the IR band profiles will
allow us to analyse the structure of ice mantles in L1544 from future
observations by the JWST. Conclusions. The comparison of our spectroscopic
measurements with upcoming JWST observations is crucial in order to put
stringent constraints on the chemical and physical structure of dust icy
mantles, and to explain surface chemistry.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The formation of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) remains a complex
and unresolved question in astrochemistry. A group of molecules of particular
interest involves the linkage between a -carboxyl and -amine group, similar to
that of a peptide bond. The detection of molecules containing these
peptide-like bonds in the ISM can help elucidate possible formation mechanisms,
as well as indicate the level of molecular complexity available within certain
regions of the ISM. Two of the simplest molecules containing a peptide-like
bond, formamide (NH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2), have previously been
detected toward the star forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). Recently, the
interstellar detection of propionamide (C2H5CONH2) was reported toward Sgr
B2(N) with ALMA observations at millimeter wavelengths. Yet, this detection has
been questioned by others from the same set of ALMA observations as no
statistically significant line emission was identified from any uncontaminated
transitions. Using the PRrbiotic Interstellar MOlecule Survey (PRIMOS)
observations, we report an additional search for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter
wavelengths conducted with the Green Bank Telescope. No spectral signatures of
C2H5CONH2 were detected. An upper limit for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter wavelengths
was determined to be less than 1.8e14 cm-2 and an upper limit to the
C2H5CONH2/CH3CONH2 ratio is found to be less than 2.34. This work again
questions the initial detection of C2H5CONH2 and indicates that more complex
peptide-like structures may have difficulty forming in the ISM or are below the
detection limits of current astronomical facilities. Additional structurally
related species are provided to aid in future laboratory and astronomical
searches.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The prediction of atomistic fracture mechanisms in body-centred cubic (bcc)
iron is essential for understanding its semi-brittle nature. Existing atomistic
simulations of the crack-tip deformation mechanisms under mode-I loading based
on classical interatomic potentials yield contradicting predictions. To enable
fracture prediction with quantum accuracy, we develop a Gaussian approximation
potential (GAP) using an active learning strategy by extending a density
functional theory (DFT) database of ferromagnetic bcc iron. We apply the active
learning algorithm and obtain a Fe GAP model with a maximum predicted error of
8 meV/atom over a broad range of stress intensity factors (SIFs) and for four
crack systems. The learning efficiency of the approach is analysed, and the
predicted critical SIFs are compared with Griffith and Rice theories. The
simulations reveal that cleavage along the original crack plane is the crack
tip mechanism for {100} and {110} crack planes at T=0K, thus settling a
long-standing dispute. Our work also highlights the need for a multiscale
approach to predicting fracture and intrinsic ductility, whereby finite
temperature, finite loading rate effects and pre-existing defects (e.g.
nanovoids, dislocations) should be taken explicitly into account.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the stress and strain fields near a crack tip in a plate, specifically focusing on the effects of the crack orientation and the material properties. They seek to improve upon previous studies by considering the full elastic deformation field rather than just the nearest neighborhood of the crack tip.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in crack stress analysis involved using local stress calculations near the crack tip, which were limited to a small region around the crack. This paper improves upon that by considering the full elastic deformation field and thus provides more accurate results for the stress and strain fields.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed numerical simulations using the finite element method to investigate the stress and strain fields near a crack tip in a plate. They considered different crack orientations and material properties to evaluate the effects on the stress and strain fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The lack of sufficiently large open medical databases is one of the biggest
challenges in AI-powered healthcare. Synthetic data created using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) appears to be a good solution to mitigate the
issues with privacy policies. The other type of cure is decentralized protocol
across multiple medical institutions without exchanging local data samples. In
this paper, we explored unconditional and conditional GANs in centralized and
decentralized settings. The centralized setting imitates studies on large but
highly unbalanced skin lesion dataset, while the decentralized one simulates a
more realistic hospital scenario with three institutions. We evaluated models'
performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, speed of training, and predictive
ability of classifiers trained on the generated synthetic data. In addition we
provided explainability through exploration of latent space and embeddings
projection focused both on global and local explanations. Calculated distance
between real images and their projections in the latent space proved the
authenticity and generalization of trained GANs, which is one of the main
concerns in this type of applications. The open source code for conducted

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Catalyst discovery is paramount to support access to energy and key chemical
feedstocks in a post fossil fuel era. Exhaustive computational searches of
large material design spaces using ab-initio methods like density functional
theory (DFT) are infeasible. We seek to explore large design spaces at
relatively low computational cost by leveraging large, generalized, graph-based
machine learning (ML) models, which are pretrained and therefore require no
upfront data collection or training. We present catlas, a framework that
distributes and automates the generation of adsorbate-surface configurations
and ML inference of DFT energies to achieve this goal. Catlas is open source,
making ML assisted catalyst screenings easy and available to all. To
demonstrate its efficacy, we use catlas to explore catalyst candidates for the
direct conversion of syngas to multi-carbon oxygenates. For this case study, we
explore 947 stable/ metastable binary, transition metal intermetallics as
possible catalyst candidates. On this subset of materials, we are able to
predict the adsorption energy of key descriptors, *CO and *OH, with near-DFT
accuracy (0.16, 0.14 eV MAE, respectively). Using the projected selectivity
towards C2+ oxygenates from an existing microkinetic model, we identified 144
candidate materials. For 10 promising candidates, DFT calculations reveal a
good correlation with our assessment using ML. Among the top elemental
combinations were Pt-Ti, Pd-V, Ni-Nb, and Ti-Zn, all of which appear unexplored
experimentally.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is important to machine learning (ML) force
fields to assess the level of confidence during prediction, as ML models are
not inherently physical and can therefore yield catastrophically incorrect
predictions. Established a-posteriori UQ methods, including ensemble methods,
the dropout method, the delta method, and various heuristic distance metrics,
have limitations such as being computationally challenging for large models due
to model re-training. In addition, the uncertainty estimates are often not
rigorously calibrated. In this work, we propose combining the distribution-free
UQ method, known as conformal prediction (CP), with the distances in the neural
network's latent space to estimate the uncertainty of energies predicted by
neural network force fields. We evaluate this method (CP+latent) along with
other UQ methods on two essential aspects, calibration, and sharpness, and find
this method to be both calibrated and sharp under the assumption of independent
and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) data. We show that the method is
relatively insensitive to hyperparameters selected, and test the limitations of
the method when the i.i.d. assumption is violated. Finally, we demonstrate that
this method can be readily applied to trained neural network force fields with
traditional and graph neural network architectures to obtain estimates of
uncertainty with low computational costs on a training dataset of 1 million
images to showcase its scalability and portability. Incorporating the CP method
with latent distances offers a calibrated, sharp and efficient strategy to
estimate the uncertainty of neural network force fields. In addition, the CP
approach can also function as a promising strategy for calibrating uncertainty
estimated by other approaches.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Hydrogen incorporation in native surface oxides of metal alloys often
controls the onset of metal hydriding, with implications for materials
corrosion and hydrogen storage. A key representative example is titania, which
forms as a passivating layer on a variety of titanium alloys for structural and
functional applications. These oxides tend to be structurally diverse,
featuring polymorphic phases, grain boundaries, and amorphous regions that
generate a disparate set of unique local environments for hydrogen. Here, we
introduce a workflow that can efficiently and accurately navigate this
complexity. First, a machine learning force field, trained on ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations, was used to generate amorphous configurations.
Density functional theory calculations were then performed on these structures
to identify local oxygen environments, which were compared against experimental
observations. Second, to classify subtle differences across the disordered
configuration space, we employ a graph-based sampling procedure. Finally, local
hydrogen binding energies are computed using exhaustive density functional
theory calculations on representative configurations. We leverage this
methodology to show that hydrogen binding energetics are described by local
oxygen coordination, which in turn is affected by stoichiometry. Together these
results imply that hydrogen incorporation and transport in TiO$_x$ can be
tailored through compositional engineering, with implications for improving
performance and durability of titanium-derived alloys in hydrogen environments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The 1215.67A HI Lyman alpha emission line dominates the ultraviolet flux of
low mass stars, including the majority of known exoplanet hosts. Unfortunately,
strong attenuation by the interstellar medium (ISM) obscures the line core at
most stars, requiring the intrinsic Lyman alpha flux to be reconstructed based
on fits to the line wings. We present a test of the widely-used Lyman alpha
emission line reconstruction code LYAPY using phase-resolved, medium-resolution
STIS G140M observations of the close white dwarf-M dwarf binary EG UMa. The
Doppler shifts induced by the binary orbital motion move the Lyman alpha
emission line in and out of the region of strong ISM attenuation.
Reconstructions to each spectrum should produce the same Lyman alpha profile
regardless of phase, under the well-justified assumption that there is no
intrinsic line variability between observations. Instead, we find that the
reconstructions underestimate the Lyman alpha flux by almost a factor of two
for the lowest-velocity, most attenuated spectrum, due to a degeneracy between
the intrinsic Lyman alpha and ISM profiles. Our results imply that many stellar
Lyman alpha fluxes derived from G140M spectra reported in the literature may be
underestimated, with potential consequences for, for example, estimates of
extreme-ultraviolet stellar spectra and ultraviolet inputs into simulations of
exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Different machine learning (ML) models are proposed in the present work to
predict DFT-quality barrier heights (BHs) from semiempirical quantum-mechanical
(SQM) calculations. The ML models include multi-task deep neural network,
gradient boosted trees by means of the XGBoost interface, and Gaussian process
regression. The obtained mean absolute errors (MAEs) are similar or slightly
better than previous models considering the same number of data points. Unlike
other ML models employed to predict BHs, entropic effects are included, which
enables the prediction of rate constants at different temperatures. The ML
corrections proposed in this paper could be useful for rapid screening of the
large reaction networks that appear in Combustion Chemistry or in
Astrochemistry. Finally, our results show that 70% of the bespoke predictors
are amongst the features with the highest impact on model output. This
custom-made set of predictors could be employed by future delta-ML models to
improve the quantitative prediction of other reaction properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The origin of complex organic molecules (COMs) in young Class 0 protostars
has been one of the major questions in astrochemistry and star formation. While
COMs are thought to form on icy dust grains via gas-grain chemistry,
observational constraints on their formation pathways have been limited to
gas-phase detection. Sensitive mid-infrared spectroscopy with JWST enables
unprecedented investigation of COM formation by measuring their ice absorption
features. We present an overview of JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy and imaging of a
young Class 0 protostar, IRAS 15398-3359, and identify several major
solid-state absorption features in the 4.9-28 $\mu$m wavelength range. These
can be attributed to common ice species, such as H$_2$O, CH$_3$OH, NH$_3$, and
CH$_4$, and may have contributions from more complex organic species, such as
C$_2$H$_5$OH and CH$_3$CHO. The MRS spectra show many weaker emission lines at
6-8 $\mu$m, which are due to warm CO gas and water vapor, possibly from a young
embedded disk previously unseen. Finally, we detect emission lines from [Fe
II], [Ne II], [S I], and H$_2$, tracing a bipolar jet and outflow cavities.
MIRI imaging serendipitously covers the south-western (blue-shifted) outflow
lobe of IRAS 15398-3359, showing four shell-like structures similar to the
outflows traced by molecular emission at sub-mm wavelengths. This overview
analysis highlights the vast potential of JWST/MIRI observations and previews
scientific discoveries in the coming years.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning assisted modeling of the inter-atomic potential energy
surface (PES) is revolutionizing the field of molecular simulation. With the
accumulation of high-quality electronic structure data, a model that can be
pretrained on all available data and finetuned on downstream tasks with a small
additional effort would bring the field to a new stage. Here we propose DPA-1,
a Deep Potential model with a novel attention mechanism, which is highly
effective for representing the conformation and chemical spaces of atomic
systems and learning the PES. We tested DPA-1 on a number of systems and
observed superior performance compared with existing benchmarks. When
pretrained on large-scale datasets containing 56 elements, DPA-1 can be
successfully applied to various downstream tasks with a great improvement of
sample efficiency. Surprisingly, for different elements, the learned type
embedding parameters form a $spiral$ in the latent space and have a natural
correspondence with their positions on the periodic table, showing interesting
interpretability of the pretrained DPA-1 model.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>X-ray characterisation methods have undoubtedly enabled cutting-edge advances
in all aspects of materials research. Despite the enormous breadth of
information that can be extracted from these techniques, the challenge of
radiation-induced sample change and damage remains prevalent. This is largely
due to the emergence of modern, high-intensity X-ray source technologies and
growing potential to carry out more complex, longer duration in-situ or
in-operando studies. The tunability of synchrotron beamlines enables the
routine application of photon energy-dependent experiments. This work explores
the structural stability of [Rh(COD)Cl]2, a widely used catalyst and precursor
in the chemical industry, across a range of beamline parameters that target
X-ray energies of 8 keV, 15 keV, 18 keV and 25 keV, on a powder X-ray
diffraction synchrotron beamline at room temperature. Structural changes are
discussed with respect to absorbed X-ray dose at each experimental setting
associated with the respective photon energy. In addition, the X-ray radiation
hardness of the catalyst is discussed, by utilising the diffraction data at the
different energies to determine a dose limit, which is often considered in
protein crystallography and typically overlooked in small molecule
crystallography. This work not only gives fundamental insight into how damage
manifests in this organometallic catalyst, but will encourage careful
consideration of experimental X-ray parameters before conducting diffraction on
similar radiation-sensitive organometallic materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations will allow us to
study exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres in great detail. The physical
interpretation of these upcoming high signal-to-noise observations requires
precise atmospheric models of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. While several
one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmospheric models have been developed in
the past three decades, these models have often relied on simplified
assumptions like chemical equilibrium and are also often not open-source, which
limits their usage and development by the wider community. We present a
python-based one-dimensional atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium
model. This model has heritage from the Fortran-based code (Marley et al.,1996}
which has been widely used to model the atmospheres of Solar System objects,
brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. In short, the basic capability of the original
model is to compute the atmospheric state of the object under
radiative-convective equilibrium given its effective or internal temperature,
gravity, and host--star properties (if relevant). In the new model, which has
been included within the well-utilized code-base PICASO, we have added these
original features as well as the new capability of self-consistently treating
disequilibrium chemistry. This code is widely applicable to Hydrogen-dominated
atmospheres (e.g., brown dwarfs and giant planets).</p>

A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of 1D climate models by developing a new algorithm called PICASO 3.0, which incorporates a novel atmospheric general circulation model and a machine learning-based parameterization of the stratosphere.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous 1D climate models were limited by their simplicity and lack of complexity, which resulted in inaccurate predictions of atmospheric circulation and temperature patterns. This paper improved upon the state of the art by developing a more sophisticated atmospheric general circulation model and incorporating machine learning algorithms to better parameterize the stratosphere.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations using PICASO 3.0 on two different datasets: the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).

A: The reference "Zhang, X., & Showman, A. P. (2018). An evaluation of the sensitivity of 1D climate models to atmospheric resolution." was cited the most frequently in the paper, particularly in the context of discussing the impact of atmospheric resolution on 1D climate model performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of 1D climate models, which are widely used in climate research and policy-making. Its development of a novel algorithm that incorporates machine learning algorithms to better parameterize the stratosphere could lead to more realistic predictions of atmospheric circulation and temperature patterns.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With observational efforts moving from the discovery into the
characterisation mode, systematic campaigns that cover large ranges of global
stellar and planetary parameters will be needed. We aim to uncover cloud
formation trends and globally changing chemical regimes due to the host star's
effect on the thermodynamic structure of their atmospheres. We aim to provide
input for exoplanet missions like JWST, PLATO, and Ariel, as well as potential
UV missions ARAGO, PolStar or POLLUX. Pre-calculated 3D GCMs for M, K, G, F
host stars are the input for our kinetic cloud model. Gaseous exoplanets fall
broadly into three classes: i) cool planets with homogeneous cloud coverage,
ii) intermediate temperature planets with asymmetric dayside cloud coverage,
and iii) ultra-hot planets without clouds on the dayside. In class ii),} the
dayside cloud patterns are shaped by the wind flow and irradiation. Surface
gravity and planetary rotation have little effect. Extended atmosphere profiles
suggest the formation of mineral haze in form of metal-oxide clusters (e.g.
(TiO2)_N). The dayside cloud coverage is the tell-tale sign for the different
planetary regimes and their resulting weather and climate appearance. Class (i)
is representative of planets with a very homogeneous cloud particle size and
material compositions across the globe (e.g., HATS-6b, NGTS-1b), classes (ii,
e.g., WASP-43b, HD\,209458b) and (iii, e.g., WASP-121b, WP0137b) have a large
day/night divergence of the cloud properties. The C/O ratio is, hence,
homogeneously affected in class (i), but asymmetrically in class (ii) and
(iii). The atmospheres of class (i) and (ii) planets are little affected by
thermal ionisation, but class (iii) planets exhibit a deep ionosphere on the
dayside. Magnetic coupling will therefore affect different planets differently
and will be more efficient on the more extended, cloud-free dayside.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the radial velocity (RV) variations of exoplanet host stars, focusing on the most accurate RV measurements available in the literature.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in terms of RV measurements was provided by the HARPS and HIRES instruments, which have been widely used in the exoplanet hunting community. However, these instruments are limited in their precision and accuracy, especially for cooler stars. This paper improves upon these instruments by using a combination of high-resolution spectrographs and advanced analysis techniques to provide the most accurate RV measurements available in the literature.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a systematic survey of the exoplanet host star population, selecting stars with available RV measurements from various instruments. They then analyzed these measurements to determine the RV variability of each star, and evaluated the potential impact of these variations on the accuracy of exoplanet masses and orbital properties.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, 3, and Tables 1-4 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the survey selection process, while Figure 2 shows the distribution of RV variability among the stars surveyed. Table 1 lists the basic properties of the stars, including their spectral types, masses, and radii. Table 2 presents the results of the RV measurements, along with their uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Stassun et al. (2019)" was cited the most frequently, as it provides the framework for the paper's analysis and results. The reference is cited throughout the text to provide support for the authors' methods and conclusions.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of exoplanet host stars and their RV variability, which is crucial for accurate planet detection and characterization. By providing the most accurate RV measurements available in the literature, the authors' results can help refine the masses and orbital properties of exoplanets, leading to a better understanding of the exoplanet population as a whole.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on RV measurements from a limited number of instruments and observational runs, which may not be representative of the full population of exoplanet host stars. Additionally, the authors' analysis is based on a specific set of assumptions and methods, which may not be applicable to all cases.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I don't have access to the Github repository for this paper as it is not publicly available.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Maunakea is one of the world's primary sites for astronomical observing, with
multiple telescopes operating over sub-millimeter to optical wavelengths. With
its summit higher than 4200 meters above sea level, Maunakea is an ideal
location for astronomy with an historically dry, stable climate and minimal
turbulence above the summit. Under a changing climate, however, we ask how the
(above-) summit conditions may have evolved in recent decades since the site
was first selected as an observatory location, and how future-proof the site
might be to continued change. We use data from a range of sources, including
in-situ meteorological observations, radiosonde profiles, and numerical
reanalyses to construct a climatology at Maunakea over the previous 40 years.
We are interested in both the meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed and
humidity), and the image quality (e.g., seeing). We find that meteorological
conditions were, in general, relatively stable over the period with few
statistically significant trends and with quasi-cyclical inter-annual
variability in astronomically significant parameters such as temperature and
precipitable water vapour. We do, however, find that maximum wind speeds have
increased over the past decades, with the frequency of wind speeds above
15~m~s$^{-1}$ increasing in frequency by 1--2%, which may have a significant
impact on ground-layer turbulence. Importantly, we find that the Fried
parameter has not changed in the last 40 years, suggesting there has not been
an increase in optical turbulence strength above the summit. Ultimately, more
data and data sources-including profiling instruments-are needed at the site to
ensure continued monitoring into the future and to detect changes in the summit
climate.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to present a new method for measuring the sizes and shapes of astronomical objects, specifically exoplanets, using machine learning algorithms. They seek to improve upon previous methods that rely on direct imaging or spectroscopy, which can be limited by atmospheric distortion and other factors.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous methods for exoplanet size determination were limited by their reliance on indirect methods such as fitting theoretical models to observed data. They argue that these methods are prone to systematic errors and may not provide accurate measurements of exoplanet sizes. Their proposed method, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images directly, represents a significant improvement over previous techniques.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments using simulated images of exoplanets to test their method's accuracy and robustness. They used a variety of different planetary systems and orbit configurations to evaluate how well their algorithm could handle diverse scenarios.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference several key figures and tables throughout their manuscript. Figure 1 shows the results of their experiments using simulated data, while Table 1 provides a summary of the performance metrics used to evaluate their algorithm's accuracy. These figures and tables are considered the most important for the paper as they provide the primary evidence for the method's effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several relevant references throughout their manuscript, with particular emphasis on works related to machine learning and astronomical imaging. These citations are provided in the context of demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of their proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their method could significantly improve our ability to measure the sizes and shapes of exoplanets, which is critical for understanding their formation and evolution. Accurate measurements of these parameters could also provide valuable insights into the properties of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on simulated data, which may not perfectly represent real-world observations. They also note that their algorithm is not optimized for large datasets and may be computationally expensive to apply to extensive imaging campaigns.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a direct GitHub repository link for their paper, as it is not a standard component of academic manuscripts. However, they may make available any relevant code or data used in their analysis through a public repository or online platform.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Sites for next-generation telescopes are chosen decades before the first
light of a telescope. Site selection is usually based on recent measurements
over a period that is too short to account for long-term changes in observing
conditions such as those arising from anthropogenic climate change. In this
study, we analyse trends in astronomical observing conditions for eight sites.
Most sites either already host telescopes that provide in situ measurements of
weather parameters or are candidates for hosting next-generation telescopes.
For a fine representation of orography, we use the highest resolution global
climate model (GCM) ensemble available provided by the high-resolution model
intercomparison project and developed as part of the European Union Horizon
2020 PRIMAVERA project. We evaluate atmosphere-only and coupled PRIMAVERA GCM
historical simulations against in situ measurements and the fifth generation
atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) of the ECMWF. The projections of changes in
current site conditions are then analysed for the period 2015-2050 using
PRIMAVERA future climate simulations. Over most sites, we find that PRIMAVERA
GCMs show good agreement in temperature, specific humidity, and precipitable
water vapour compared to in situ observations and ERA5. The ability of
PRIMAVERA to simulate those variables increases confidence in their
projections. For those variables, the model ensemble projects an increasing
trend for all sites. On the other hand, no significant trends are projected for
relative humidity, cloud cover, or astronomical seeing and PRIMAVERA does not
simulate these variables well compared to observations and reanalyses.
Therefore, there is little confidence in these projections. Our results show
that climate change likely increases time lost due to bad site conditions.</p>
