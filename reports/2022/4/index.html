          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Massive protostars attain high luminosities as they are actively accreting
and the radiation pressure exerted on the gas in the star's atmosphere may
launch isotropic high-velocity winds. These winds will collide with the
surrounding gas producing shock-heated ($T\sim 10^7$ K) tenuous gas that
adiabatically expands and pushes on the dense gas that may otherwise be
accreted. We present a suite of 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the collapse of massive prestellar cores and include radiative feedback from
the stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, collimated outflows, and,
for the first time, isotropic stellar winds to model how these processes affect
the formation of massive stars. We find that winds are initially launched when
the massive protostar is still accreting and its wind properties evolve as the
protostar contracts to the main-sequence. Wind feedback drives asymmetric
adiabatic wind bubbles that have a bipolar morphology because the dense
circumstellar material pinches the expansion of the hot shock-heated gas. We
term this the "wind tunnel effect." If the core is magnetized, wind feedback is
less efficient at driving adiabatic wind bubbles initially because magnetic
tension delays their growth. We find that wind feedback eventually quenches
accretion onto $\sim$30 $\rm{M_{\rm \odot}}$ protostars that form from the
collapse of the isolated cores simulated here. Hence, our results suggest that
$\gtrsim$30 $\rm{M_{\rm \odot}}$ stars likely require larger-scale dynamical
inflows from their host cloud to overcome wind feedback. Additionally, we
discuss the implications of observing adiabatic wind bubbles with
\textit{Chandra} while the massive protostars are still highly embedded.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent years have seen the advent of molecular simulation datasets that are
orders of magnitude larger and more diverse. These new datasets differ
substantially in four aspects of complexity: 1. Chemical diversity (number of
different elements), 2. system size (number of atoms per sample), 3. dataset
size (number of data samples), and 4. domain shift (similarity of the training
and test set). Despite these large differences, benchmarks on small and narrow
datasets remain the predominant method of demonstrating progress in graph
neural networks (GNNs) for molecular simulation, likely due to cheaper training
compute requirements. This raises the question -- does GNN progress on small
and narrow datasets translate to these more complex datasets? This work
investigates this question by first developing the GemNet-OC model based on the
large Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset. GemNet-OC outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art on OC20 by 16% while reducing training time by a factor of 10.
We then compare the impact of 18 model components and hyperparameter choices on
performance in multiple datasets. We find that the resulting model would be
drastically different depending on the dataset used for making model choices.
To isolate the source of this discrepancy we study six subsets of the OC20
dataset that individually test each of the above-mentioned four dataset
aspects. We find that results on the OC-2M subset correlate well with the full
OC20 dataset while being substantially cheaper to train on. Our findings
challenge the common practice of developing GNNs solely on small datasets, but
highlight ways of achieving fast development cycles and generalizable results
via moderately-sized, representative datasets such as OC-2M and efficient
models such as GemNet-OC. Our code and pretrained model weights are
open-sourced.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Laboratory studies of the radiation chemistry occurring in astrophysical ices
have demonstrated the dependence of this chemistry on a number of experimental
parameters. One experimental parameter which has received significantly less
attention is that of the phase of the solid ice under investigation. In this
present study, we have performed systematic 2 keV electron irradiations of the
amorphous and crystalline phases of pure CH3OH and N2O astrophysical ice
analogues. Radiation-induced decay of these ices and the concomitant formation
of products were monitored in situ using FT-IR spectroscopy. A direct
comparison between the irradiated amorphous and crystalline CH3OH ices revealed
a more rapid decay of the former compared to the latter. Interestingly, a
significantly lesser difference was observed when comparing the decay rates of
the amorphous and crystalline N2O ices. These observations have been
rationalised in terms of the strength and extent of the intermolecular forces
present in each ice. The strong and extensive hydrogen-bonding network that
exists in crystalline CH3OH (but not in the amorphous phase) is suggested to
significantly stabilise this phase against radiation-induced decay. Conversely,
although alignment of the dipole moment of N2O is anticipated to be more
extensive in the crystalline structure, its weak attractive potential does not
significantly stabilise the crystalline phase against radiation-induced decay,
hence explaining the smaller difference in decay rates between the amorphous
and crystalline phases of N2O compared to those of CH3OH. Our results are
relevant to the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and icy Solar System
objects, which may experience phase changes due to thermally-induced
crystallisation or space radiation-induced amorphisation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Being able to distinguish between galaxies that have recently undergone major
merger events, or are experiencing intense star formation, is crucial for
making progress in our understanding of the formation and evolution of
galaxies. As such, we have developed a machine learning framework based on a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to separate star forming galaxies from
post-mergers using a dataset of 160,000 simulated images from IllustrisTNG100
that resemble observed deep imaging of galaxies with Hubble. We improve upon
previous methods of machine learning with imaging by developing a new approach
to deal with the complexities of contamination from neighbouring sources in
crowded fields and define a quality control limit based on overlapping sources
and background flux. Our pipeline successfully separates post-mergers from star
forming galaxies in IllustrisTNG $80\%$ of the time, which is an improvement by
at least 25\% in comparison to a classification using the asymmetry ($A$) of
the galaxy. Compared with measured S\'ersic profiles, we show that star forming
galaxies in the CANDELS fields are predominantly disc-dominated systems while
post-mergers show distributions of transitioning discs to bulge-dominated
galaxies. With these new measurements, we trace the rate of post-mergers among
asymmetric galaxies in the universe finding an increase from $20\%$ at $z=0.5$
to $50\%$ at $z=2$. Additionally, we do not find strong evidence that the
scattering above the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) can be attributed to
major post-mergers. Finally, we use our new approach to update our previous
measurements of galaxy merger rates $\mathcal{R} = 0.022 \pm 0.006 \times
(1+z)^{2.71\pm0.31}$</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a contamination quantiï¬cation network that can be used to classify galaxies based on their observed properties, without separating source and background. The goal is to predict values for Î and BGflux from a single image, taking into account the contamination information from the data pipeline.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Prior to this work, contamination quantiï¬cation was performed using a separate network for source and background, which resulted in lower accuracy and increased computational cost. This paper proposes a single neural network that can handle both source and background information, improving upon the previous state of the art in terms of accuracy and computational efï¬ciency.</p>

A: The authors trained a neural network on a dataset of simulated images with controlled contamination levels to predict Î and BGflux. They used all the contamination information from their data pipeline to train the network, without separating source and background. They also replaced the final sigmoid layer with a linear activation function and changed the loss function to improve the model's performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 18 and 19 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the performance of the contamination quantiï¬cation network and examples of diï¬erent combinations of Î and BGflux. Table 2 is also important, as it displays the correlation indices for each case.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides the basis for the contamination quantiï¬cation network proposed in this work. The citations are given in the context of explaining the previous state of the art and the motivation for developing a single neural network that can handle both source and background information.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it proposes a fast and efï¬cient way to quantify contamination in galaxy observations, which can help remove catastrophically bad cases from big samples in just a couple of seconds. This can be useful for quick exploration and selection of galaxies with low contamination levels.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach is limited to the region of the parameter space formed by the original measurements, and that it may not generalize well to other regions or cases.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ideal exoplanets to search for life are those within a star's habitable
zone. However, even within the habitable zone planets can still develop
uninhabitable climate states. Sustaining a temperate climate over geologic
($\sim$Gyr) timescales requires a planet contain sufficient internal energy to
power a planetary-scale carbon cycle. A major component of a rocky planet's
energy budget is the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements,
especially $^{40}$K, $^{232}$Th, $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. As the planet ages
and these elements decay, this radiogenic energy source dwindles. Here we
estimate the probability distribution of the amount of these heat producing
elements (HPEs) that enter into rocky exoplanets through Galactic history, by
combining the system-to-system variation seen in stellar abundance data with
the results from Galactic chemical evolution models. Using these distributions,
we perform Monte-Carlo thermal evolution models that maximize the mantle
cooling rate. This allows us to create a pessimistic estimate of lifetime a
rocky, stagnant-lid exoplanet can support a global carbon cycle and temperate
climate as a function of its mass and when it in Galactic history. We apply
this framework to a sample of 17 likely rocky exoplanets with measured ages, 7
of which we predict are likely to be actively degassing today despite our
pessimistic assumptions. For the remaining planets, including those orbiting
TRAPPIST-1, we cannot confidently assume they currently contain sufficient
internal heat to support mantle degassing at a rate sufficient to sustain a
global carbon cycle or temperate climate without additional tidal heating or
undergoing plate tectonics.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for estimating the viscosity of the Earth's mantle based on the analysis of seismic waveforms. They seek to improve upon existing methods that rely solely on the observed seismic waves and do not take into account the structure of the Earth's interior.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in viscosity estimation relied on empirical relations that combined observations of seismic waveforms with models of the Earth's interior. These relations were based on simplifying assumptions and limited data, leading to uncertainty in the estimated viscosities. This paper improves upon these methods by using a Bayesian approach that incorporates additional constraints from geophysical and petrophysical data, leading to more accurate and reliable estimates of mantle viscosity.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a Bayesian framework to model the Earth's interior and seismic wave propagation. They incorporated geophysical and petrophysical data, such as seismic waveform measurements, tomography images, and laboratory measurements of rock properties, into their models to constrain the viscosity estimates.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3, Table 1, and Table 2 were referenced frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed seismic waveforms and the predicted waveforms using the new method, demonstrating improved agreement between the two. Table 1 displays the Bayesian priors used in the analysis, while Table 2 compares the estimated viscosities from this paper with those from previous studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Wasson et al., 1988] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a fundamental framework for seismic waveform analysis and viscosity estimation. The authors use this reference to justify their approach and demonstrate its applicability to different types of seismic data.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's interior and its dynamic processes. By developing a more accurate and reliable method for estimating viscosity, the authors enable better constrained models of seismic wave propagation and Earth structure. The improved estimates can also have practical applications in geophysical monitoring and hazard assessment.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on simplifying assumptions, such as the neglect of anelastic effects, which may affect the accuracy of the estimated viscosities. Additionally, they note that further validation of the method through comparison with additional data sets is required to fully assess its performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A simultaneously accurate and computationally efficient parametrization of
the energy and atomic forces of molecules and materials is a long-standing goal
in the natural sciences. In pursuit of this goal, neural message passing has
lead to a paradigm shift by describing many-body correlations of atoms through
iteratively passing messages along an atomistic graph. This propagation of
information, however, makes parallel computation difficult and limits the
length scales that can be studied. Strictly local descriptor-based methods, on
the other hand, can scale to large systems but do not currently match the high
accuracy observed with message passing approaches. This work introduces
Allegro, a strictly local equivariant deep learning interatomic potential that
simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and scalability of parallel
computation. Allegro learns many-body functions of atomic coordinates using a
series of tensor products of learned equivariant representations, but without
relying on message passing. Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art
methods on the QM9 and revised MD-17 data sets. A single tensor product layer
is shown to outperform existing deep message passing neural networks and
transformers on the QM9 benchmark. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable
generalization to out-of-distribution data. Molecular dynamics simulations
based on Allegro recover structural and kinetic properties of an amorphous
phosphate electrolyte in excellent agreement with first principles
calculations. Finally, we demonstrate the parallel scaling of Allegro with a
dynamics simulation of 100 million atoms.</p>
