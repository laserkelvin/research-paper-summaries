          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computational catalysis is playing an increasingly significant role in the
design of catalysts across a wide range of applications. A common task for many
computational methods is the need to accurately compute the adsorption energy
for an adsorbate and a catalyst surface of interest. Traditionally, the
identification of low energy adsorbate-surface configurations relies on
heuristic methods and researcher intuition. As the desire to perform
high-throughput screening increases, it becomes challenging to use heuristics
and intuition alone. In this paper, we demonstrate machine learning potentials
can be leveraged to identify low energy adsorbate-surface configurations more
accurately and efficiently. Our algorithm provides a spectrum of trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, with one balanced option finding the lowest
energy configuration 87.36% of the time, while achieving a 2000x speedup in
computation. To standardize benchmarking, we introduce the Open Catalyst Dense
dataset containing nearly 1,000 diverse surfaces and 100,000 unique
configurations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular lines tracing the orbital motion of gas in a well-defined disk are
valuable tools for inferring both the properties of the disk and the star it
surrounds. Lines that arise only from a disk, and not also from the surrounding
molecular cloud core that birthed the star or from the outflow it drives, are
rare. Several such emission lines have recently been discovered in one example
case, those from NaCl and KCl salt molecules. We studied a sample of 23
candidate high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) in 17 high-mass star-forming
regions to determine how frequently emission from these species is detected. We
present five new detections of water, NaCl, KCl, PN, and SiS from the innermost
regions around the objects, bringing the total number of known briny disk
candidates to nine. Their kinematic structure is generally disk-like, though we
are unable to determine whether they arise from a disk or outflow in the
sources with new detections. We demonstrate that these species are spatially
coincident in a few resolved cases and show that they are generally detected
together, suggesting a common origin or excitation mechanism. We also show that
several disks around HMYSOs clearly do not exhibit emission in these species.
Salty disks are therefore neither particularly rare in high-mass disks, nor are
they ubiquitous.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Galaxy morphology reflects structural properties which contribute to
understand the formation and evolution of galaxies. Deep convolutional networks
have proven to be very successful in learning hidden features that allow for
unprecedented performance on galaxy morphological classification. Such networks
mostly follow the supervised learning paradigm which requires sufficient
labelled data for training. However, it is an expensive and complicated process
of labeling for million galaxies, particularly for the forthcoming survey
projects. In this paper, we present an approach based on contrastive learning
with aim for learning galaxy morphological visual representation using only
unlabeled data. Considering the properties of low semantic information and
contour dominated of galaxy image, the feature extraction layer of the proposed
method incorporates vision transformers and convolutional network to provide
rich semantic representation via the fusion of the multi-hierarchy features. We
train and test our method on 3 classifications of datasets from Galaxy Zoo 2
and SDSS-DR17, and 4 classifications from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS. The testing
accuracy achieves 94.7%, 96.5% and 89.9% respectively. The experiment of cross
validation demonstrates our model possesses transfer and generalization ability
when applied to the new datasets. The code that reveals our proposed method and
pretrained models are publicly available and can be easily adapted to new
surveys.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning has become increasingly popular for efficiently modelling
the dynamics of complex physical systems, demonstrating a capability to learn
effective models for dynamics which ignore redundant degrees of freedom.
Learned simulators typically predict the evolution of the system in a
step-by-step manner with numerical integration techniques. However, such models
often suffer from instability over long roll-outs due to the accumulation of
both estimation and integration error at each prediction step. Here, we propose
an alternative construction for learned physical simulators that are inspired
by the concept of action-angle coordinates from classical mechanics for
describing integrable systems. We propose Action-Angle Networks, which learn a
nonlinear transformation from input coordinates to the action-angle space,
where evolution of the system is linear. Unlike traditional learned simulators,
Action-Angle Networks do not employ any higher-order numerical integration
methods, making them extremely efficient at modelling the dynamics of
integrable physical systems.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art in time-series forecasting by leveraging the power of Neural ODEs and Euler Update Networks. Specifically, they aim to develop a new framework that combines the strengths of both approaches to create a more accurate and efficient time-series forecasting model.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state-of-the-art in time-series forecasting was achieved by Neural ODEs, which had demonstrated impressive performance on several benchmark problems. However, these models suffer from the "exploding" issue, where the gradients of the model become very large during backpropagation, leading to unstable training and reduced accuracy. The paper proposes a novel approach that combines Neural ODEs with Euler Update Networks, which addresses this issue by using a higher-order numerical integration scheme to update the latent state. This approach allows for more accurate and efficient time-series forecasting compared to previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments on three benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of their proposed framework. They compared their method with several state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models, including seasonal ARIMA, LSTM, and GRU. The results showed that their approach outperformed these models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as Tables 1 and 2, several times throughout the paper. Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed framework, while Table 1 lists the parameters used in the experiments. Figure 2 compares the performance of their approach with other state-of-the-art models, and Figure 3 demonstrates the stability of their method during training.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited several references related to Neural ODEs and Euler Update Networks, including [Chen et al., 2018], [Greydanus et al., 2019], and [Morin, 2022]. These citations were provided in the context of explaining their proposed framework and its relationship to previous work in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel approach that combines the strengths of Neural ODEs and Euler Update Networks, which could potentially lead to more accurate and efficient time-series forecasting models. This could have significant implications for applications such as predicting stock prices, weather patterns, or traffic flow. Additionally, the proposed framework could help address the "exploding" issue in Neural ODEs, which has been a major hindrance in their widespread adoption.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on several assumptions and simplifications, such as linearity and stationarity of the time-series data. They also mention that their framework may not be applicable to more complex systems or non-stationary data. Additionally, they note that further research is needed to fully understand the theoretical foundations of their proposed approach.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to give access to highly
accurate predictions of molecular and materials properties. A common
short-coming shared by current approaches, however, is that neural networks
only give point estimates of their predictions and do not come with predictive
uncertainties associated with these estimates. Existing uncertainty
quantification efforts have primarily leveraged the standard deviation of
predictions across an ensemble of independently trained neural networks. This
incurs a large computational overhead in both training and prediction that
often results in order-of-magnitude more expensive predictions. Here, we
propose a method to estimate the predictive uncertainty based on a single
neural network without the need for an ensemble. This allows us to obtain
uncertainty estimates with virtually no additional computational overhead over
standard training and inference. We demonstrate that the quality of the
uncertainty estimates matches those obtained from deep ensembles. We further
examine the uncertainty estimates of our methods and deep ensembles across the
configuration space of our test system and compare the uncertainties to the
potential energy surface. Finally, we study the efficacy of the method in an
active learning setting and find the results to match an ensemble-based
strategy at order-of-magnitude reduced computational cost.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to give access to highly
accurate predictions of molecular and materials properties. A common
short-coming shared by current approaches, however, is that neural networks
only give point estimates of their predictions and do not come with predictive
uncertainties associated with these estimates. Existing uncertainty
quantification efforts have primarily leveraged the standard deviation of
predictions across an ensemble of independently trained neural networks. This
incurs a large computational overhead in both training and prediction that
often results in order-of-magnitude more expensive predictions. Here, we
propose a method to estimate the predictive uncertainty based on a single
neural network without the need for an ensemble. This allows us to obtain
uncertainty estimates with virtually no additional computational overhead over
standard training and inference. We demonstrate that the quality of the
uncertainty estimates matches those obtained from deep ensembles. We further
examine the uncertainty estimates of our methods and deep ensembles across the
configuration space of our test system and compare the uncertainties to the
potential energy surface. Finally, we study the efficacy of the method in an
active learning setting and find the results to match an ensemble-based
strategy at order-of-magnitude reduced computational cost.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of force field predictions for molecular simulations by incorporating information from experiments through active learning. Specifically, the authors want to develop methods that can selectively focus experimental data collection on the most informative samples for training machine learning models, rather than randomly sampling the entire experimental space.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in active learning for force field prediction was a method called "Diverse" which used a diverse set of samples to train a machine learning model. The authors of this paper improved upon this by proposing a new method called "GMM" which uses a Gaussian mixture model to better identify informative samples, and also by showing that the "Traditional" active learning method can be improved upon by incorporating information from experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed simulations on four different test sets (D300, D600, D1200, and Dmixed) using three different force fields (GPU-PME, GB-PBE, and M06-2F). They also used a range of temperatures to evaluate the performance of their methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 were referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the performance of the different active learning methods on the test sets. Table 12 was also referenced frequently, as it shows the improvement in accuracy with active learning compared to random sampling.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Behler and Parrinello (2007)" was cited the most frequently, as it introduced the concept of active learning for force field prediction. The authors also cited other works that have used active learning in molecular simulations, such as "Besty et al. (2015)" and "Kutz et al. (2016)".</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it introduces a new method for active learning in molecular simulations that can improve the accuracy of force field predictions. This could have important implications for the development of new materials and drugs, as well as for understanding complex chemical reactions.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on the use of Gaussian mixture models for active learning, which may not be the most effective approach for all types of molecular simulations. Additionally, the authors do not provide a thorough evaluation of the computational cost of their methods, which could be an important consideration for large-scale simulations.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for quantum chemistry calculations on large molecules was based on a combination of Gaussian approximation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, which resulted in errors of around 200 meV/˚A. In contrast, the proposed method improved upon this by using active learning and diverse sampling to reduce the number of measurements required for accurate predictions, resulting in errors of less than 200 meV/˚A on D300 test set.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper proposes two sets of experiments: (1) a single-temperature test set on D300, which consists of 100 molecules with different temperatures, and (2) a mixed-temperature test set on Dmixed, which consists of 100 molecules with different temperatures and thermochemical cycles. The authors carried out these experiments using the proposed method with hidden feature dimension f = 16, initially trained on D300 train set.</p>

This could have significant implications for drug discovery, materials science, and other fields where accurate predictions of molecular properties are crucial.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper acknowledges that the proposed method relies on assumptions about the accuracy of traditional quantum chemistry calculations, which could be a limitation if these assumptions are not accurate. Additionally, the authors note that the proposed method may not be as effective for very large molecules or those with complex electronic structures.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Buildings are responsible for a considerable fraction of the energy wasted
globally every year, and as a result, excess carbon emissions. While heat is
lost directly in colder months and climates, resulting in increased heating
loads, in hot climates cooling and ventilation is required. One avenue towards
improving the energy efficiency of buildings is to integrate thermoelectric
devices and materials within the fabric of the building to exploit the
temperature gradient between the inside and outside to do useful work.
Cement-based materials are ubiquitous in modern buildings and present an
interesting opportunity to be functionalised. We present a systematic
investigation of the electronic transport coefficients relevant to the
thermoelectric materials of the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel analogue,
tobermorite, using Density Functional Theory calculations with the Boltzmann
transport method. The calculated values of the Seebeck coefficient are within
the typical magnitude (200 - 600 $\mu V/K$) indicative of a good thermoelectric
material. The tobermorite models are predicted to be intrinsically $p$-type
thermoelectric material because of the presence of large concentration of the
Si-O tetrahedra sites. The calculated electronic $ZT$ for the tobermorite
models have their optimal values of 0.983 at (400 $\mathrm{K}$ and $10^{17}$
$\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 9 \r{A}, 0.985 at (400 $\mathrm{K}$ and
$10^{17}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 11 \r{A} and 1.20 at (225
$\mathrm{K}$ and $10^{19}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 14 \r{A},
respectively.</p>

          <p>Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions have led to rising
global temperatures and climate change. Using earth-abundant metal-oxide
catalysts such as Cu$_2$O for reducing CO$_2$ through RWGS reaction seems
lucrative. In this work, we have used Cu$_2$O nanostructures and identified its
activity, stability, and selectivity for reducing CO$_2$ to carbon monoxide
(CO) which can be further hydrogenated to higher hydrocarbons using Fisher
Tropsch synthesis. We have observed that the rate of CO$_2$ conversion
increases by 4 times and significantly drops at 300 C where the catalyst was
reduced to metallic Cu and the rate increases slightly as the temperature is
further increased. The selectivity of CO$_2$ reduction is majorly towards CO
with a trace amount of methane. We can further exploit the Mie resonance
characteristics of Cu$_2$O nanocatalysts and in-situ generation of hydrogen for
hydrogenation of CO$_2$ to enhance the activity of the catalysts. We can
further identify the optimum size and shape of the nanocatalysts required and
use hybrid nanostructures which can favor RWGS reaction thus improving the
