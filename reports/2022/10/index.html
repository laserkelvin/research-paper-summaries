          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Density based representations of atomic environments that are invariant under
Euclidean symmetries have become a widely used tool in the machine learning of
interatomic potentials, broader data-driven atomistic modelling and the
visualisation and analysis of materials datasets.The standard mechanism used to
incorporate chemical element information is to create separate densities for
each element and form tensor products between them. This leads to a steep
scaling in the size of the representation as the number of elements increases.
Graph neural networks, which do not explicitly use density representations,
escape this scaling by mapping the chemical element information into a fixed
dimensional space in a learnable way. We recast this approach as tensor
factorisation by exploiting the tensor structure of standard neighbour density
based descriptors. In doing so, we form compact tensor-reduced representations
whose size does not depend on the number of chemical elements, but remain
systematically convergeable and are therefore applicable to a wide range of
data analysis and regression tasks.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) models for describing the electronic structure of molecules. They observe that current GAP models have limited descriptor length, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and high computational cost. The paper proposes a new approach to GAP models that uses a tensor-reduced feature space to improve accuracy while reducing computational cost.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previously, the state-of-theart GAP models were based on the Full SOAP (FSOAP) model, which uses the full power spectrum to represent the electronic structure of molecules. However, FSOAP can be computationally expensive and may not be accurate for larger molecules. The proposed paper improves upon this by using a tensor-reduced feature space, which reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most important information for predicting the electronic structure of molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments on a dataset of 160 molecules using three GAP models with different architectures. They evaluated the accuracy of the models using a test set of 20 molecules and compared their performance to the previous state-of-the-art FSOAP model. They also analyzed the convergence of energy errors on the test set as a function of descriptor length for various GAP models.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-5 and Tables 1-3 were referenced most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the convergence of energy errors on the test set as a function of descriptor length, while Table 1 provides an overview of the MACE models used in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [47] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed description of the HME21 dataset used in the study. The reference [48] was also cited for providing additional details on the MACE models used in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a new approach to GAP models that can improve accuracy while reducing computational cost, which can be particularly useful for large-scale simulations of complex molecular systems. The proposed method can also be applied to other quantum mechanical models, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which can lead to further advancements in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on the accuracy and efficiency of GAP models, without providing a comprehensive comparison with other quantum mechanical methods, such as DFT or Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the tensor-reduced feature space used in their proposed method.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The aim of this white paper is to briefly summarize some of the outstanding
gaps in the observations and modeling of stellar flares, CMEs, and exoplanetary
space weather, and to discuss how the theoretical and computational tools and
methods that have been developed in heliophysics can play a critical role in
meeting these challenges. The maturity of data-inspired and data-constrained
modeling of the Sun-to-Earth space weather chain provides a natural starting
point for the development of new, multidisciplinary research and applications
to other stars and their exoplanetary systems. Here we present recommendations
for future solar CME research to further advance stellar flare and CME studies.
These recommendations will require institutional and funding agency support for
both fundamental research (e.g. theoretical considerations and idealized
eruptive flare/CME numerical modeling) and applied research (e.g. data
inspired/constrained modeling and estimating exoplanetary space weather
impacts). In short, we recommend continued and expanded support for: (1.)
Theoretical and numerical studies of CME initiation and low coronal evolution,
including confinement of "failed" eruptions; (2.) Systematic analyses of
Sun-as-a-star observations to develop and improve stellar CME detection
techniques and alternatives; (3.) Improvements in data-inspired and
data-constrained MHD modeling of solar CMEs and their application to stellar
systems; and (4.) Encouraging comprehensive solar--stellar research
collaborations and conferences through new interdisciplinary and
multi-agency/division funding mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the Open MatSci ML Toolkit: a flexible, self-contained, and
scalable Python-based framework to apply deep learning models and methods on
scientific data with a specific focus on materials science and the OpenCatalyst
Dataset. Our toolkit provides: 1. A scalable machine learning workflow for
materials science leveraging PyTorch Lightning, which enables seamless scaling
across different computation capabilities (laptop, server, cluster) and
hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, XPU). 2. Deep Graph Library (DGL) support for
rapid graph neural network prototyping and development. By publishing and
sharing this toolkit with the research community via open-source release, we
hope to: 1. Lower the entry barrier for new machine learning researchers and
practitioners that want to get started with the OpenCatalyst dataset, which
presently comprises the largest computational materials science dataset. 2.
Enable the scientific community to apply advanced machine learning tools to
high-impact scientific challenges, such as modeling of materials behavior for
clean energy applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by
enabling three new equivariant neural network models for multiple OpenCatalyst

          <p>We report the detection of magnesium dicarbide, MgC$_2$, in the laboratory at
centimeter wavelengths and assign $^{24}$MgC$_2$, $^{25}$MgC$_2$, and
$^{26}$MgC$_2$ to 14 unidentified lines in the radio spectrum of the
circumstellar envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216. The structure of
MgC$_2$ is found to be T-shaped with a highly ionic bond between the metal atom
and the C$_2$ unit, analogous to other dicarbides containing electropositive
elements. A two-temperature excitation model of the MgC$_2$ emission lines
observed in IRC+10216 yields a very low rotational temperature of $6\pm1$ K, a
kinetic temperature of $22\pm13$ K, and a column density of $(1.0 \pm 0.3)
\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. The abundance of MgC$_2$ relative to the
magnesium-carbon chains MgCCH, MgC$_4$H, and MgC$_6$H is $1{:}2{:}22{:}20$ and
provides a new constraint on the sequential radiative association-dissociative
recombination mechanisms implicated in the production of metal-bearing

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The angular momentum of galaxies (galaxy spin) contains rich information
about the initial condition of the Universe, yet it is challenging to
efficiently measure the spin direction for the tremendous amount of galaxies
that are being mapped by the ongoing and forthcoming cosmological surveys. We
present a machine learning based classifier for the Z-wise vs S-wise spirals,
which can help to break the degeneracy in the galaxy spin direction
measurement. The proposed Chirality Equivariant Residual Network (CE-ResNet) is
manifestly equivariant under a reflection of the input image, which guarantees
that there is no inherent asymmetry between the Z-wise and S-wise probability
estimators. We train the model with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images,
with the training labels given by the Galaxy Zoo 1 (GZ1) project. A combination
of data augmentation tricks are used during the training, making the model more
robust to be applied to other surveys. We find a $\sim\!30\%$ increase of both
types of spirals when Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) images are
used for classification, due to the better imaging quality of DESI. We verify
that the $\sim\!7\sigma$ difference between the numbers of Z-wise and S-wise
spirals is due to human bias, since the discrepancy drops to $<\!1.8\sigma$
with our CE-ResNet classification results. We discuss the potential systematics
that are relevant to the future cosmological applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The angular momentum of galaxies (galaxy spin) contains rich information
about the initial condition of the Universe, yet it is challenging to
efficiently measure the spin direction for the tremendous amount of galaxies
that are being mapped by the ongoing and forthcoming cosmological surveys. We
present a machine learning based classifier for the Z-wise vs S-wise spirals,
which can help to break the degeneracy in the galaxy spin direction
measurement. The proposed Chirality Equivariant Residual Network (CE-ResNet) is
manifestly equivariant under a reflection of the input image, which guarantees
that there is no inherent asymmetry between the Z-wise and S-wise probability
estimators. We train the model with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images,
with the training labels given by the Galaxy Zoo 1 (GZ1) project. A combination
of data augmentation tricks are used during the training, making the model more
robust to be applied to other surveys. We find a $\sim\!30\%$ increase of both
types of spirals when Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) images are
used for classification, due to the better imaging quality of DESI. We verify
that the $\sim\!7\sigma$ difference between the numbers of Z-wise and S-wise
spirals is due to human bias, since the discrepancy drops to $<\!1.8\sigma$
with our CE-ResNet classification results. We discuss the potential systematics
that are relevant to the future cosmological applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are materials with a high degree of porosity
that can be used for applications in energy storage, water desalination, gas
storage, and gas separation. However, the chemical space of MOFs is close to an
infinite size due to the large variety of possible combinations of building
blocks and topology. Discovering the optimal MOFs for specific applications
requires an efficient and accurate search over an enormous number of potential
candidates. Previous high-throughput screening methods using computational
simulations like DFT can be time-consuming. Such methods also require
optimizing 3D atomic structure of MOFs, which adds one extra step when
evaluating hypothetical MOFs. In this work, we propose a structure-agnostic
deep learning method based on the Transformer model, named as MOFormer, for
property predictions of MOFs. The MOFormer takes a text string representation
of MOF (MOFid) as input, thus circumventing the need of obtaining the 3D
structure of hypothetical MOF and accelerating the screening process.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework that pretrains
the MOFormer via maximizing the cross-correlation between its
structure-agnostic representations and structure-based representations of
crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) on >400k publicly available
MOF data. Using self-supervised learning allows the MOFormer to intrinsically
learn 3D structural information though it is not included in the input.
Experiments show that pretraining improved the prediction accuracy of both
models on various downstream prediction tasks. Furthermore, we revealed that
MOFormer can be more data-efficient on quantum-chemical property prediction
than structure-based CGCNN when training data is limited. Overall, MOFormer
provides a novel perspective on efficient MOF design using deep learning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Migrating active deicing capabilities to transparent materials with low
thermal conductivity has a high potential to improve the operations of several
seminal industries in the automotive, robotic, energy, and aerospace sectors.
However, the development of efficient and environmentally friendly deicing
methods is yet in its infancy regarding their compatibility with end-user
surfaces at relevant scales and real-world operations. Herein, we approach
deicing through nanoscale surface activation enabled by surface acoustic waves
(SAWs), allowing efficient on-demand deicing of surface areas spanning several
square centimeters covered with thick layers of glace ice. We contemplate
SAW-based deicing from a twofold perspective: First, we demonstrate its
functionality both with a bulk piezoelectric material (LiNbO3) and a
piezo-electric film (ZnO), the latter proving its versatile applicability to a
large variety of functional materials with practical importance; second, we
gain fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for efficient deicing
using SAWs. In particular, we show that SAW vibrational modes easily transport
energy over greater distances outside the electrode areas and efficiently melt
large ice aggregates covering the materials' surfaces. In addition, the
essential physics of SAW-based deicing is inferred from a carefully designed
experimental and numerical study. We support our findings by providing
macroscopic camera snapshots captured in situ inside a climate chamber during
deicing and highly resolved laser-doppler vibrometer scans of the undisturbed
wavefields at room temperature. Great care was taken to deposit the
interdigital transducers (IDTs) used for SAW excitation only on ice-free areas
close to the chip edges, leaving most of the substrate used for deicing
unaltered and, as a matter of fact, demonstrating transparent deicing
solutions.</p>

          <p>First such observations were made in 1892 and since then various sites around
the world have carried out regular observations, with Kodaikanal, Meudon, Mt
Wilson, and Coimbra being some of the most prominent ones. By now, Ca II K
observations from over 40 different sites allow an almost complete daily
coverage of the last century. Ca II K images provide direct information on
plage and network regions on the Sun and, through their connection to solar
surface magnetic field, offer an excellent opportunity to study solar magnetism
over more than a century. This makes them also extremely important, among
others, for solar irradiance reconstructions and studies of the solar influence
on Earth's climate. However, these data also suffer from numerous issues, which
for a long time have hampered their analysis. Without properly addressing these
issues, Ca II K data cannot be used to their full potential. Here, we first
