          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The rapid progress of machine learning interatomic potentials over the past
couple of years produced a number of new architectures. Particularly notable
among these are the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), which unified many of the
earlier ideas around atom density-based descriptors, and Neural Equivariant
Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), a message passing neural network with
equivariant features that showed state of the art accuracy. In this work, we
construct a mathematical framework that unifies these models: ACE is
generalised so that it can be recast as one layer of a multi-layer
architecture. From another point of view, the linearised version of NequIP is
understood as a particular sparsification of a much larger polynomial model.
Our framework also provides a practical tool for systematically probing
different choices in the unified design space. We demonstrate this by an
ablation study of NequIP via a set of experiments looking at in- and
out-of-domain accuracy and smooth extrapolation very far from the training
data, and shed some light on which design choices are critical for achieving
high accuracy. Finally, we present BOTNet (Body-Ordered-Tensor-Network), a
much-simplified version of NequIP, which has an interpretable architecture and
maintains accuracy on benchmark datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We review Skilling's nested sampling (NS) algorithm for Bayesian inference
and more broadly multi-dimensional integration. After recapitulating the
principles of NS, we survey developments in implementing efficient NS
algorithms in practice in high-dimensions, including methods for sampling from
the so-called constrained prior. We outline the ways in which NS may be applied
and describe the application of NS in three scientific fields in which the
algorithm has proved to be useful: cosmology, gravitational-wave astronomy, and
materials science. We close by making recommendations for best practice when
using NS and by summarizing potential limitations and optimizations of NS.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the key mysteries of star formation is the origin of the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). The IMF is observed to be nearly universal in the
Milky Way and its satellites, and significant variations are only inferred in
extreme environments, such as the cores of massive elliptical galaxies. In this
work we present simulations from the STARFORGE project that are the first
cloud-scale RMHD simulations that follow individual stars and include all
relevant physical processes. The simulations include detailed gas
thermodynamics, as well as stellar feedback in the form of protostellar jets,
stellar radiation, winds and supernovae. In this work we focus on how stellar
radiation, winds and supernovae impact star-forming clouds. Radiative feedback
plays a major role in quenching star formation and disrupting the cloud,
however the IMF peak is predominantly set by protostellar jet physics. We find
the effect of stellar winds is minor, and supernovae occur too late}to affect
the IMF or quench star formation. We also investigate the effects of initial
conditions on the IMF. The IMF is insensitive to the initial turbulence, cloud
mass and cloud surface density, even though these parameters significantly
shape the star formation history of the cloud, including the final star
formation efficiency. The characteristic stellar mass depends weakly on
metallicity and the interstellar radiation field. Finally, while turbulent
driving and the level of magnetization strongly influences the star formation
history, they only influence the high-mass slope of the IMF.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for simulating star formation in clouds with high resolution was done by Padoan et al. (2018). This paper improved upon it by using a higher mass resolution to better study the impact of numerical resolution on the derived IMF.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations with different mass resolutions to examine the sensitivity of the derived IMF to numerical resolution. They used a cloud with a mass of M2e3 and applied all physics included (C_M_J_R_W, see Table 1).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1, A2, and A3 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure A1 shows the evolution of the star formation rate per freefall time (𝜖ﬀ), number of sink particles (𝑁sink), and the virial parameter (𝛼) as a function of time for an M2e3 cloud with all physics included (C_M_J_R_W, see Table 1).

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning approaches have the potential to approximate Density
Functional Theory (DFT) for atomistic simulations in a computationally
efficient manner, which could dramatically increase the impact of computational
simulations on real-world problems. However, they are limited by their accuracy
and the cost of generating labeled data. Here, we present an online active
learning framework for accelerating the simulation of atomic systems
efficiently and accurately by incorporating prior physical information learned
by large-scale pre-trained graph neural network models from the Open Catalyst
Project. Accelerating these simulations enables useful data to be generated
more cheaply, allowing better models to be trained and more atomistic systems
to be screened. We also present a method of comparing local optimization
techniques on the basis of both their speed and accuracy. Experiments on 30
benchmark adsorbate-catalyst systems show that our method of transfer learning
to incorporate prior information from pre-trained models accelerates
simulations by reducing the number of DFT calculations by 91%, while meeting an
accuracy threshold of 0.02 eV 93% of the time. Finally, we demonstrate a
technique for leveraging the interactive functionality built in to VASP to
efficiently compute single point calculations within our online active learning
framework without the significant startup costs. This allows VASP to work in
tandem with our framework while requiring 75% fewer self-consistent cycles than
conventional single point calculations. The online active learning
implementation, and examples using the VASP interactive code, are available in
the open source FINETUNA package on Github.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The "quasi-constant" SOAP and ACSF fingerprint manifolds recently discovered
by Parsaeifard and Goedecker are a direct consequence of the presence of
degenerate pairs of configurations, a known shortcoming of all low-body-order
atom-density correlation representations of molecular structures. Contrary to
the configurations that are rigorously singular -- that we demonstrate can only
occur in finite, discrete sets -- the continuous "quasi-constant" manifolds
exhibit low, but non-zero, sensitivity to atomic displacements. Thus, it is
possible to build interpolative machine-learning models of high-order
interactions along the manifold, even though the numerical instabilities
associated with proximity to the exact singularities affect the accuracy and
transferability of such models, to an extent that depends on numerical details
of the implementation.</p>
