          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The rapid progress of machine learning interatomic potentials over the past
couple of years produced a number of new architectures. Particularly notable
among these are the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), which unified many of the
earlier ideas around atom density-based descriptors, and Neural Equivariant
Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), a message passing neural network with
equivariant features that showed state of the art accuracy. In this work, we
construct a mathematical framework that unifies these models: ACE is
generalised so that it can be recast as one layer of a multi-layer
architecture. From another point of view, the linearised version of NequIP is
understood as a particular sparsification of a much larger polynomial model.
Our framework also provides a practical tool for systematically probing
different choices in the unified design space. We demonstrate this by an
ablation study of NequIP via a set of experiments looking at in- and
out-of-domain accuracy and smooth extrapolation very far from the training
data, and shed some light on which design choices are critical for achieving
high accuracy. Finally, we present BOTNet (Body-Ordered-Tensor-Network), a
much-simplified version of NequIP, which has an interpretable architecture and
maintains accuracy on benchmark datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We review Skilling's nested sampling (NS) algorithm for Bayesian inference
and more broadly multi-dimensional integration. After recapitulating the
principles of NS, we survey developments in implementing efficient NS
algorithms in practice in high-dimensions, including methods for sampling from
the so-called constrained prior. We outline the ways in which NS may be applied
and describe the application of NS in three scientific fields in which the
algorithm has proved to be useful: cosmology, gravitational-wave astronomy, and
materials science. We close by making recommendations for best practice when
using NS and by summarizing potential limitations and optimizations of NS.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the key mysteries of star formation is the origin of the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). The IMF is observed to be nearly universal in the
Milky Way and its satellites, and significant variations are only inferred in
extreme environments, such as the cores of massive elliptical galaxies. In this
work we present simulations from the STARFORGE project that are the first
cloud-scale RMHD simulations that follow individual stars and include all
relevant physical processes. The simulations include detailed gas
thermodynamics, as well as stellar feedback in the form of protostellar jets,
stellar radiation, winds and supernovae. In this work we focus on how stellar
radiation, winds and supernovae impact star-forming clouds. Radiative feedback
plays a major role in quenching star formation and disrupting the cloud,
however the IMF peak is predominantly set by protostellar jet physics. We find
the effect of stellar winds is minor, and supernovae occur too late}to affect
the IMF or quench star formation. We also investigate the effects of initial
conditions on the IMF. The IMF is insensitive to the initial turbulence, cloud
mass and cloud surface density, even though these parameters significantly
shape the star formation history of the cloud, including the final star
formation efficiency. The characteristic stellar mass depends weakly on
metallicity and the interstellar radiation field. Finally, while turbulent
driving and the level of magnetization strongly influences the star formation
history, they only influence the high-mass slope of the IMF.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the impact of numerical resolution on the derived IMF, specifically in a cloud with a mass of M2e3. They want to determine whether the IMF is sensitive to numerical resolution or not.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for simulating star formation in clouds with high resolution was done by Padoan et al. (2018). This paper improved upon it by using a higher mass resolution to better study the impact of numerical resolution on the derived IMF.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations with different mass resolutions to examine the sensitivity of the derived IMF to numerical resolution. They used a cloud with a mass of M2e3 and applied all physics included (C_M_J_R_W, see Table 1).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1, A2, and A3 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure A1 shows the evolution of the star formation rate per freefall time (𝜖ﬀ), number of sink particles (𝑁sink), and the virial parameter (𝛼) as a function of time for an M2e3 cloud with all physics included (C_M_J_R_W, see Table 1). Figure A2 shows the evolution of the number-weighted mean (𝑀mean), number-weighted median (𝑀med), mass-weighted median (𝑀50), and maximum (𝑀max) sink mass as a function of time for an M2e3 cloud with all physics included (C_M_J_R_W, see Table 1).

          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is Padoan et al. (2018). The paper is cited in the context of improving upon the previous state of the art for simulating star formation in clouds with high resolution.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it provides insight into the sensitivity of the derived IMF to numerical resolution, which is a crucial factor in understanding the accuracy of star formation models. If the IMF is found to be sensitive to numerical resolution, this could have implications for the interpretation of observations and the development of new models.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of numerical resolution on the derived IMF across all possible cloud masses and physical parameters. Future work could focus on expanding the scope of the study to cover a wider range of clouds and physical conditions. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the effect of other simulation parameters, such as the choice of gravitational softening length or the numerical viscosity, on the derived IMF.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning approaches have the potential to approximate Density
Functional Theory (DFT) for atomistic simulations in a computationally
efficient manner, which could dramatically increase the impact of computational
simulations on real-world problems. However, they are limited by their accuracy
and the cost of generating labeled data. Here, we present an online active
learning framework for accelerating the simulation of atomic systems
efficiently and accurately by incorporating prior physical information learned
by large-scale pre-trained graph neural network models from the Open Catalyst
Project. Accelerating these simulations enables useful data to be generated
more cheaply, allowing better models to be trained and more atomistic systems
to be screened. We also present a method of comparing local optimization
techniques on the basis of both their speed and accuracy. Experiments on 30
benchmark adsorbate-catalyst systems show that our method of transfer learning
to incorporate prior information from pre-trained models accelerates
simulations by reducing the number of DFT calculations by 91%, while meeting an
accuracy threshold of 0.02 eV 93% of the time. Finally, we demonstrate a
technique for leveraging the interactive functionality built in to VASP to
efficiently compute single point calculations within our online active learning
framework without the significant startup costs. This allows VASP to work in
tandem with our framework while requiring 75% fewer self-consistent cycles than
conventional single point calculations. The online active learning
implementation, and examples using the VASP interactive code, are available in
the open source FINETUNA package on Github.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The "quasi-constant" SOAP and ACSF fingerprint manifolds recently discovered
by Parsaeifard and Goedecker are a direct consequence of the presence of
degenerate pairs of configurations, a known shortcoming of all low-body-order
atom-density correlation representations of molecular structures. Contrary to
the configurations that are rigorously singular -- that we demonstrate can only
occur in finite, discrete sets -- the continuous "quasi-constant" manifolds
exhibit low, but non-zero, sensitivity to atomic displacements. Thus, it is
possible to build interpolative machine-learning models of high-order
interactions along the manifold, even though the numerical instabilities
associated with proximity to the exact singularities affect the accuracy and
transferability of such models, to an extent that depends on numerical details
of the implementation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In a data-driven paradigm, machine learning (ML) is the central component for
developing accurate and universal exchange-correlation (XC) functionals in
density functional theory (DFT). It is well known that XC functionals must
satisfy several exact conditions and physical constraints, such as density
scaling, spin scaling, and derivative discontinuity. In this work, we
demonstrate that contrastive learning is a computationally efficient and
flexible method to incorporate a physical constraint in ML-based density
functional design. We propose a schematic approach to incorporate the uniform
density scaling property of electron density for exchange energies by adopting
contrastive representation learning during the pretraining task. The pretrained
hidden representation is transferred to the downstream task to predict the
exchange energies calculated by DFT. The electron density encoder transferred
from the pretraining task based on contrastive learning predicts exchange
energies that satisfy the scaling property, while the model trained without
using contrastive learning gives poor predictions for the scaling-transformed
electron density systems. Furthermore, the model with pretrained encoder gives
a satisfactory performance with only small fractions of the whole augmented
dataset labeled, comparable to the model trained from scratch using the whole
dataset. The results demonstrate that incorporating exact constraints through
contrastive learning can enhance the understanding of density-energy mapping
using neural network (NN) models with less data labeling, which will be
beneficial to generalizing the application of NN-based XC functionals in a wide
range of scenarios that are not always available experimentally but
theoretically justified. This work represents a viable pathway toward the
machine learning design of a universal density functional via representation
learning.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a method for predicting exchange energies in molecule systems using a contrastive learning approach. The authors aim to improve upon previous state-of-the-art methods, which rely on supervised learning and require large amounts of labeled data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for predicting exchange energies in molecule systems was achieved by supervised learning models that used a combination of feature engineering and transfer learning. However, these models require large amounts of labeled data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. In contrast, the proposed method uses a contrastive learning approach that does not require labeled data, making it more efficient and scalable.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose using a contrastive learning approach combined with transfer learning to predict exchange energies in molecule systems. They use a ResNet or DoubleConv density encoder to encode the molecular structures into a compact representation, and then use a projection matrix to map the encoded representations onto a lower-dimensional space. The authors also explore the effect of different label percentages on the performance of the model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the comparison of performance between supervised learning and contrastive learning models on datasets with different scaling factors. Table 1 is also important, as it shows the performance of different models trained using various label percentages.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] is cited the most frequently, as it provides a general overview of contrastive learning and its applications. The authors also cite [2], which introduces the concept of density encoding and its use in machine learning.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it proposes a novel approach to predicting exchange energies in molecule systems using contrastive learning, which does not require large amounts of labeled data. This could make it more efficient and scalable than previous methods, which rely on supervised learning and require large amounts of labeled data.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the proposed method relies on a specific type of contrastive learning algorithm, which may not be applicable to all molecule systems or problems. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on a wide range of datasets, which could limit its generalizability.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We are witnessing a great transition towards a society powered by renewable
energies to meet the ever-stringent climate target. Hydrogen, as an energy
carrier, will play a key role in building a climate-neutral society. Although
liquid hydrogen is essential for hydrogen storage and transportation,
liquefying hydrogen is costly with the conventional methods based on
Joule-Thomas effect. As an emerging technology which is potentially more
efficient, magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction is a "game-changer". In this
work, we have investigated the rare-earth-based Laves phases ${\rm R}Al_2$ and
${\rm R}Ni_2$ for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. We have noticed an
unaddressed feature that the magnetocaloric effect of second-order
magnetocaloric materials can become "giant" near the hydrogen boiling point.
This feature indicates strong correlations, down to the boiling point of
hydrogen, among the three important quantities of the magnetocaloric effect:
the maximum magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$, the maximum adiabatic
temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$, and the Curie temperature $T_C$. Via
a comprehensive literature review, we interpret the correlations for a
rare-earth intermetallic series as two trends: (1) $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$
increases with decreasing $T_C$; (2) $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$ decreases near room
temperature with decreasing $T_C$ but increases at cryogenic temperatures.
Moreover, we have developed a mean-field approach to describe these two trends
theoretically. The dependence of $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$ and $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$
on $T_C$ revealed in this work helps us quickly anticipate the magnetocaloric
performance of rare-earth-based compounds, guiding material design and
accelerating the discoveries of magnetocaloric materials for hydrogen
liquefaction.</p>
