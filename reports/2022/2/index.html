          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an approach for using machine learning to automatically discover
the governing equations and hidden properties of real physical systems from
observations. We train a "graph neural network" to simulate the dynamics of our
solar system's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data.
We then use symbolic regression to discover an analytical expression for the
force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is
equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions that were
required were translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second
and third laws of motion. Our approach correctly discovered the form of the
symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did not require any assumptions
about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants. They, too, were
accurately inferred through our methods. Though, of course, the classical law
of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our result serves as a
validation that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from
observed data. More broadly this work represents a key step toward realizing
the potential of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>It is expected that as the Sun travels through the interstellar medium (ISM),
there will be different filtration of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) that affect
Earth. The effect of GCR on Earth's atmosphere and climate is still uncertain.
Although the interaction with molecular clouds was previously considered, the
terrestrial impact of compact cold clouds was neglected. There is overwhelming
geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes that Earth was in direct
contact with the ISM 2 million years ago, and the local ISM is home to several
nearby cold clouds. Here we show, with a state-of the art simulation that
incorporate all the current knowledge about the heliosphere that if the solar
system passed through a cloud such as Local Leo Cold Cloud, then the
heliosphere which protects the solar system from interstellar particles, must
have shrunk to a scale smaller than the Earth's orbit around the Sun (0.22).
Using a magnetohydrodynamic simulation that includes charge exchange between
neutral atoms and ions, we show that during the heliosphere shrinkage, Earth
was exposed to a neutral hydrogen density of up to 3000cm-3. This could have
had drastic effects on Earth's climate and potentially on human evolution at
that time, as suggested by existing data.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the structure and evolution of the heliosphere, specifically focusing on the shrinkage of the heliosphere due to the interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). They seek to understand how this shrinkage affects the solar system's planets and how it can be modeled using current computational methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in heliosphere modeling included simplified models that assumed a constant density ISM and neglected the effects of radiation and momentum transfer. This paper improved upon those models by incorporating more realistic ISM densities and velocities, as well as radiative and momentum transfer processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed a series of simulations using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to investigate the structure and evolution of the heliosphere. They varied the ISM density and velocity profiles to study their impact on the heliosphere's structure and shrinkage.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the 3D image of the heliosphere with two views, while Figure 2 provides a close view of the heliosphere's structure 2 Myr ago.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce SignNet and BasisNet -- new neural architectures that are
invariant to two key symmetries displayed by eigenvectors: (i) sign flips,
since if $v$ is an eigenvector then so is $-v$; and (ii) more general basis
symmetries, which occur in higher dimensional eigenspaces with infinitely many
choices of basis eigenvectors. We prove that under certain conditions our
networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of
eigenvectors with the desired invariances. When used with Laplacian
eigenvectors, our networks are provably more expressive than existing spectral
methods on graphs; for instance, they subsume all spectral graph convolutions,
certain spectral graph invariants, and previously proposed graph positional
encodings as special cases. Experiments show that our networks significantly
outperform existing baselines on molecular graph regression, learning
expressive graph representations, and learning neural fields on triangle
meshes. Our code is available at https://github.com/cptq/SignNet-BasisNet .</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to address the problem of learning from graph-structured data with partial observability, which is a challenging task in machine learning due to the complexity and variability of graphs. They propose SignNet, a novel architecture that leverages both spectral and spatial information to learn node features that capture the structural properties of the graph.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in partial observability graph learning was the Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, which relies on matrix factorization techniques to handle missing data. However, GNNs are limited by their reliance on local neighborhood aggregation and their inability to capture long-range dependencies. SignNet improves upon GNNs by incorporating spectral information into the learning process, allowing it to capture global structural properties of the graph more effectively.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets for graph-structured data with partial observability: (1) a random graph dataset from Chen et al. (2020) for counting substructures, and (2) a synthetic dataset from Corso et al. (2020) for regressing graph properties. They compared SignNet with other state-of-the-art methods for handling partial observability, including Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 3, 4, and 5, and Table 1 are the most frequently referenced. These figures illustrate the performance of SignNet on different datasets and compare it with other methods, while Table 1 provides an overview of the hyperparameter settings used in the experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Rustamov et al., 2007) is cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical foundation for SignNet's spectral-spatial learning framework. The authors also cite (Chen et al., 2020) and (Corso et al., 2020) for their relevant work on graph neural networks and graph property regression, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: SignNet offers a novel approach to learning from graph-structured data with partial observability, which is a fundamental challenge in many real-world applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. By leveraging both spectral and spatial information, SignNet can capture complex structural properties of graphs more effectively than existing methods, potentially leading to improved performance in these applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that SignNet's reliance on spectral information may not be effective for all graph types or datasets, and suggest future work to explore other forms of spatial information, such as node features, to enhance the learning process. Additionally, they note that SignNet's computational complexity may limit its applicability to very large graphs.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The paper does not provide a direct Github repository link, but the authors offer a publicly available implementation of SignNet on GitHub.</p>
