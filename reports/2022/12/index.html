          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Intelligently extracting and linking complex scientific information from
unstructured text is a challenging endeavor particularly for those
inexperienced with natural language processing. Here, we present a simple
sequence-to-sequence approach to joint named entity recognition and relation
extraction for complex hierarchical information in scientific text. The
approach leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM), GPT-3, that is
fine-tuned on approximately 500 pairs of prompts (inputs) and completions
(outputs). Information is extracted either from single sentences or across
sentences in abstracts/passages, and the output can be returned as simple
English sentences or a more structured format, such as a list of JSON objects.
We demonstrate that LLMs trained in this way are capable of accurately
extracting useful records of complex scientific knowledge for three
representative tasks in materials chemistry: linking dopants with their host
materials, cataloging metal-organic frameworks, and general
chemistry/phase/morphology/application information extraction. This approach
represents a simple, accessible, and highly-flexible route to obtaining large
databases of structured knowledge extracted from unstructured text. An online
demo is available at http://www.matscholar.com/info-extraction.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In the coldest (10--20 K) regions of the interstellar medium, the icy
surfaces of interstellar grains serve as solid-state supports for chemical
reactions. Among their plausible roles, that of third body is advocated, in
which the reaction energies of surface reactions dissipate throughout the
grain, stabilizing the product. This energy dissipation process is poorly
understood at the atomic scale, although it can have a high impact on
Astrochemistry. Here, we study, by means of quantum mechanical simulations, the
formation of NH3 via successive H-additions to atomic N on water ice surfaces,
paying special attention to the third body role. We first characterize the
hydrogenation reactions and the possible competitive processes (i.e.,
H-abstractions), in which the H-additions are more favourable than the
H-abstractions. Subsequently, we study the fate of the hydrogenation reaction
energies by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Results show
that around 58--90\% of the released energy is quickly absorbed by the ice
surface, inducing a temporary increase of the ice temperature. Different energy
dissipation mechanisms are distinguished. One mechanism, more general, is based
on the coupling of the highly excited vibrational modes of the newly formed
species and the libration modes of the icy water molecules. A second mechanism,
exclusive during the NH$_3$ formation, is based on the formation of a transient
H$_3$O$^+$/NH$_2^-$ ion pair, which significantly accelerates the energy
transfer to the surface. Finally, the astrophysical implications of our
findings relative to the interstellar synthesis of NH$_3$ and its chemical
desorption into the gas are discussed.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>From the Archean toward the Proterozoic, the Earth's atmosphere underwent a
major shift from anoxic to oxic conditions, around 2.4 to 2.1 Gyr, known as the
Great Oxidation Event (GOE). This rapid transition may be related to an
atmospheric instability caused by the formation of the ozone layer. Previous
works were all based on 1D photochemical models. Here, we revisit the GOE with
a 3D photochemical-climate model to investigate the possible impact of the
atmospheric circulation and the coupling between the climate and the dynamics
of the oxidation. We show that the diurnal, seasonal and transport variations
do not bring significant changes compared to 1D models. Nevertheless, we
highlight a temperature dependence for atmospheric photochemical losses. A
cooling during the late Archean could then have favored the triggering of the
oxygenation. In addition, we show that the Huronian glaciations, which took
place during the GOE, could have introduced a fluctuation in the evolution of
the oxygen level. Finally, we show that the oxygen overshoot which is expected
to have occurred just after the GOE, was likely accompanied by a methane
overshoot. Such high methane concentrations could have had climatic
consequences and could have played a role in the dynamics of the Huronian
glaciations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Despite investments in multiple space and ground-based solar observatories by
the global community, the Sun's polar regions remain unchartered territory -
the last great frontier for solar observations. Breaching this frontier is
fundamental to understanding the solar cycle - the ultimate driver of
short-to-long term solar activity that encompasses space weather and space
climate. Magnetohydrodynamic dynamo models and empirically observed
relationships have established that the polar field is the primary determinant
of the future solar cycle amplitude. Models of solar surface evolution of
tilted active regions indicate that the mid to high latitude surges of magnetic
flux govern dynamics leading to the reversal and build-up of polar fields. Our
theoretical understanding and numerical models of this high latitude magnetic
field dynamics and plasma flows - that are a critical component of the sunspot
cycle - lack precise observational constraints. This limitation compromises our
ability to observe the enigmatic kilo Gauss polar flux patches and constrain
the polar field distribution at high latitudes. The lack of these observations
handicap our understanding of how high latitude magnetic fields power polar
jets, plumes, and the fast solar wind that extend to the boundaries of the
heliosphere and modulate solar open flux and cosmic ray flux within the solar
system. Accurate observation of the Sun's polar regions, therefore, is the
single most outstanding challenge that confronts Heliophysics. This paper
argues the scientific case for novel out of ecliptic observations of the Sun's
polar regions, in conjunction with existing, or future multi-vantage point
heliospheric observatories. Such a mission concept can revolutionize the field
of Heliophysics like no other mission concept has - with relevance that
transcends spatial regimes from the solar interior to the heliosphere.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Schwabe (~11 yr) value for the annual sunspot number is sometimes
uncritically applied to other measures of solar activity, direct and indirect,
including the 10.7 cm radio flux, the inflow of galactic cosmic rays, solar
flare frequency, terrestrial weather, and components of space climate, with the
risk of a resulting loss of information. The ruling (Babcock) hypothesis and
its derivatives link the sunspot cycle to dynamo processes mediated by
differential solar rotation, but despite 60 years of observation and analysis
the ~11 yr periodicity remains difficult to model; the possible contribution of
planetary dynamics is undergoing a revival. The various solar sequences that
genuinely display an ~11 yr cycle stand to benefit from an understanding of its
periodicity that goes beyond statistical kinship. The outcome could ironically
prompt the demotion of sunspots from their dominant historical role in favour
of other possible indicators of solar cyclicity, such as the solar wind flux
and its isotopic signatures, even if they are less accessible.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present images at 6 and 14 GHz of Source I in Orion-KL. At higher
frequencies, from 43 to 340 GHz, images of this source are dominated by thermal
emission from dust in a 100 AU diameter circumstellar disk, but at 6 and 14 GHz
the emission is elongated along the minor axis of the disk, aligned with the
SiO bipolar outflow from the central object. Gaussian fits to the 6, 14, 43,
and 99 GHz images find a component along the disk minor axis whose flux and
length vary with frequency consistent with free-free emission from an ionized
outflow. The data favor a broad outflow from a disk wind, rather than a narrow
ionized jet. Source I was undetected in higher resolution 5 GHz e-MERLIN
observations obtained in 2021. The 5-6 GHz structure of SrcI may be resolved
out by the high sidelobe structure of the e-MERLIN synthesized beam, or be time
variable.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the scientific world to intensify
virus-related studies, aimed at the development of quick and safe ways of
detecting viruses in human body, studying the virus-antibody and virus-cell
interactions, and designing nanocarriers for targeted antiviral therapies.
However, research on dangerous viruses can only be performed in certified
laboratories that follow strict safety procedures. Thus, developing deactivated
virus constructs or safe-to-use virus-like objects, which imitate real viruses
and allow performing virus-related studies in any research laboratory,
constitutes an important scientific challenge. One of the groups of such
species are the so-called virus-like particles (VLPs). Instead of capsids with
viral DNA/RNA, VLPs have synthetic cores with real virus proteins attached to
them. We have developed a method for the preparation of VLPs imitating the
virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease: the SARS-CoV-2. The particles have
Au cores surrounded by "coronas" of S1 domains of the virus's Spike protein.
Importantly, they are safe to use and specifically interact with SARS-CoV-2
antibodies. Moreover, Au cores exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR), which makes the synthesized VLPs suitable for biosensing applications.
Within our studies, the effect allowed us to visualize the interaction between
the VLPs and the antibodies and identify the characteristic vibrational
signals. What is more, additional functionalization of the particles with a
fluorescent label revealed their potential in studying specific virus-related
interactions. Notably, the universal character of the developed synthesis
method makes it potentially applicable for fabricating VLPs imitating other
life-threatening viruses.</p>
