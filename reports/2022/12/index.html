          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Intelligently extracting and linking complex scientific information from
unstructured text is a challenging endeavor particularly for those
inexperienced with natural language processing. Here, we present a simple
sequence-to-sequence approach to joint named entity recognition and relation
extraction for complex hierarchical information in scientific text. The
approach leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM), GPT-3, that is
fine-tuned on approximately 500 pairs of prompts (inputs) and completions
(outputs). Information is extracted either from single sentences or across
sentences in abstracts/passages, and the output can be returned as simple
English sentences or a more structured format, such as a list of JSON objects.
We demonstrate that LLMs trained in this way are capable of accurately
extracting useful records of complex scientific knowledge for three
representative tasks in materials chemistry: linking dopants with their host
materials, cataloging metal-organic frameworks, and general
chemistry/phase/morphology/application information extraction. This approach
represents a simple, accessible, and highly-flexible route to obtaining large
databases of structured knowledge extracted from unstructured text. An online
demo is available at http://www.matscholar.com/info-extraction.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of materials science extraction tasks by developing a hierarchical graph-based model, LLM-NERRE. The authors aim to recognize not just relationships between individual entities, but hierarchical relationships with relationship types which need not be explicitly and comprehensively enumerated beforehand.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon existing work in natural language processing (NLP) and materials science extraction, specifically the use of neural networks for relationship extraction. The authors improve upon the previous state of the art by introducing a hierarchical graph-based model that can capture complex relationships between entities and their substructures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments using a test set of 320 abstracts from materials science papers to evaluate the performance of the LLM-NERRE model. They used class support tables to analyze the model's performance in various tasks, such as doping, host-dopant relationships, and general materials NERRE.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference Figures S1-S4 and Tables S1-S4 most frequently in the text. These figures and tables provide visualizations of the hierarchical graph structure and class support for various tasks, which are important for understanding the performance and capabilities of the LLM-NERRE model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several references related to NLP and materials science extraction. They cite the paper by Li et al. (2015) most frequently, which is a previous work on hierarchical graph-based relationship extraction. The citations are provided in the context of building upon existing work and improving upon the previous state of the art.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that the LLM-NERRE model has the potential to be impactful or important due to its ability to capture complex relationships between entities and their substructures, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of materials science extraction tasks. They also suggest that the model's hierarchical structure can enable more precise and comprehensive relationships than previous models.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach is limited to materials science abstracts and may not generalize well to other domains or contexts. They also note that the model's performance can be improved with additional training data or modifications to the architecture.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In the coldest (10--20 K) regions of the interstellar medium, the icy
surfaces of interstellar grains serve as solid-state supports for chemical
reactions. Among their plausible roles, that of third body is advocated, in
which the reaction energies of surface reactions dissipate throughout the
grain, stabilizing the product. This energy dissipation process is poorly
understood at the atomic scale, although it can have a high impact on
Astrochemistry. Here, we study, by means of quantum mechanical simulations, the
formation of NH3 via successive H-additions to atomic N on water ice surfaces,
paying special attention to the third body role. We first characterize the
hydrogenation reactions and the possible competitive processes (i.e.,
H-abstractions), in which the H-additions are more favourable than the
H-abstractions. Subsequently, we study the fate of the hydrogenation reaction
energies by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Results show
that around 58--90\% of the released energy is quickly absorbed by the ice
surface, inducing a temporary increase of the ice temperature. Different energy
dissipation mechanisms are distinguished. One mechanism, more general, is based
on the coupling of the highly excited vibrational modes of the newly formed
species and the libration modes of the icy water molecules. A second mechanism,
exclusive during the NH$_3$ formation, is based on the formation of a transient
H$_3$O$^+$/NH$_2^-$ ion pair, which significantly accelerates the energy
transfer to the surface. Finally, the astrophysical implications of our
findings relative to the interstellar synthesis of NH$_3$ and its chemical
desorption into the gas are discussed.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>From the Archean toward the Proterozoic, the Earth's atmosphere underwent a
major shift from anoxic to oxic conditions, around 2.4 to 2.1 Gyr, known as the
Great Oxidation Event (GOE). This rapid transition may be related to an
atmospheric instability caused by the formation of the ozone layer. Previous
works were all based on 1D photochemical models. Here, we revisit the GOE with
a 3D photochemical-climate model to investigate the possible impact of the
atmospheric circulation and the coupling between the climate and the dynamics
of the oxidation. We show that the diurnal, seasonal and transport variations
do not bring significant changes compared to 1D models. Nevertheless, we
highlight a temperature dependence for atmospheric photochemical losses. A
cooling during the late Archean could then have favored the triggering of the
oxygenation. In addition, we show that the Huronian glaciations, which took
place during the GOE, could have introduced a fluctuation in the evolution of
the oxygen level. Finally, we show that the oxygen overshoot which is expected
to have occurred just after the GOE, was likely accompanied by a methane
overshoot. Such high methane concentrations could have had climatic
consequences and could have played a role in the dynamics of the Huronian
glaciations.</p>
