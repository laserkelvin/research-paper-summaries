          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Equivariant neural networks (ENNs) have been shown to be extremely effective
in applications involving underlying symmetries. By construction ENNs cannot
produce lower symmetry outputs given a higher symmetry input. However, symmetry
breaking occurs in many physical systems and we may obtain a less symmetric
stable state from an initial highly symmetric one. Hence, it is imperative that
we understand how to systematically break symmetry in ENNs. In this work, we
propose a novel symmetry breaking framework that is fully equivariant and is
the first which fully addresses spontaneous symmetry breaking. We emphasize
that our approach is general and applicable to equivariance under any group. To
achieve this, we introduce the idea of symmetry breaking sets (SBS). Rather
than redesign existing networks, we design sets of symmetry breaking objects
which we feed into our network based on the symmetry of our inputs and outputs.
We show there is a natural way to define equivariance on these sets, which
gives an additional constraint. Minimizing the size of these sets equates to
data efficiency. We prove that minimizing these sets translates to a well
studied group theory problem, and tabulate solutions to this problem for the
point groups. Finally, we provide some examples of symmetry breaking to
demonstrate how our approach works in practice.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Generative modelling aims to accelerate the discovery of novel chemicals by
directly proposing structures with desirable properties. Recently, score-based,
or diffusion, generative models have significantly outperformed previous
approaches. Key to their success is the close relationship between the score
and physical force, allowing the use of powerful equivariant neural networks.
However, the behaviour of the learnt score is not yet well understood. Here, we
analyse the score by training an energy-based diffusion model for molecular
generation. We find that during the generation the score resembles a
restorative potential initially and a quantum-mechanical force at the end. In
between the two endpoints, it exhibits special properties that enable the
building of large molecules. Using insights from the trained model, we present
Similarity-based Molecular Generation (SiMGen), a new method for zero shot
molecular generation. SiMGen combines a time-dependent similarity kernel with
descriptors from a pretrained machine learning force field to generate
molecules without any further training. Our approach allows full control over
the molecular shape through point cloud priors and supports conditional
generation. We also release an interactive web tool that allows users to
generate structures with SiMGen online (https://zndraw.icp.uni-stuttgart.de).</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for training neural networks that can converge much faster than previous methods, reducing the number of iterations required to achieve good performance. They also seek to improve the computational efficiency of the training process.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in neural network training was the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which had been shown to be effective in many applications. However, SGD can be slow to converge, especially for larger models and datasets. This paper introduces a new method called "super-convergence," which achieves faster convergence than SGD by using large learning rates. The authors show that their method can achieve better performance than SGD while also being more computationally efficient.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their super-convergence method. They train neural networks on several benchmark datasets using both SGD and their proposed method, and compare the resulting model performances. They also analyze the convergence behavior of their method and discuss its implications for training neural networks.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1, which shows the convergence curves of several benchmark datasets using SGD and the proposed super-convergence method, is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. Table 1, which compares the performance of different optimization methods on a variety of datasets, is also reference frequently.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is [60], which is mentioned several times throughout the paper as a basis for the authors' method. The authors also cite [61] and [62] multiple times, both of which provide background information on neural network training and optimization methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of neural network training, which could have a major impact on a wide range of applications. They also note that their method is relatively simple and easy to implement, making it accessible to a broad range of researchers and practitioners.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method may not be as effective for all types of neural networks or datasets, and that further research is needed to fully understand its limitations. They also note that their method relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, such as linear convergence, which may not always hold in practice.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a
highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in
the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect
particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young
stellar object (YSO) clusters identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills
cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with
either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show
that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.5 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20
below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest
that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of
massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via
either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the best-fitting stellar population model for the galaxy M31 by comparing the observed colors and magnitudes with synthetic spectra generated from different models.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in determining the stellar population of a galaxy involved using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, which relies on the assumption that the SED of a star is a function of its temperature and luminosity. However, this approach has limitations when dealing with complex galaxies like M31, as it cannot account for the effects of dust extinction or the presence of multiple stellar populations. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by using a more sophisticated modeling approach that takes into account these complications and provides a more accurate determination of the stellar population of M31.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of observational data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and theoretical modeling to investigate the properties of the stellar population in M31. They created a set of synthetic spectra for different stellar populations, including those with different ages, metallicities, and dust contents, and compared these spectra to the observed colors and magnitudes of stars in M31.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 2-4 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed colors and magnitudes of stars in M31, while Figures 2 and 3 display the synthetic spectra generated from different stellar populations. Table 2 lists the parameters used to generate these spectra, while Table 3 compares the observed colors and magnitudes with the predictions from different models.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Townsley et al. 2006] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive review of the methods used to determine the stellar population of galaxies. The authors also cite [Wolk et al. 2006], which discusses the use of SED fitting for this purpose, and [Vink et al. 2001], which presents a detailed modeling approach for determining the stellar population of galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of galaxy evolution studies as it provides a more accurate determination of the stellar population in M31, which will help constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution. It also demonstrates the potential of using a sophisticated modeling approach that takes into account the complexities of dust extinction and multiple stellar populations, which could be applied to other galaxies as well.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a simplifying assumption that the observed colors and magnitudes of stars in M31 are solely due to the effects of dust extinction and stellar population heterogeneity, without considering other factors such as the presence of binary stars or variable stars. However, this limitation does not significantly affect the overall conclusion of the paper, which is that a more sophisticated modeling approach can provide a better determination of the stellar population in M31.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose fine-tuning large language models for generation of stable
materials. While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded
atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled
structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using
energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and
gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned
LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice
the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text
prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for
unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures
and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability
to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale,
suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for
atomistic data.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper proposes a template method for constructing a table of similar element substitutions that can be used for local optimization around an existing material. The goal is to improve the material's properties by introducing mutations that do not significantly affect the overall structure, but rather specific properties such as the bond length or angle of certain atoms.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, previous methods for local optimization around existing materials were limited by their reliance on random search or simple heuristics, which often resulted in poor exploration of the material's potential. The proposed template method improves upon these methods by using a more systematic and efficient approach that takes into account the chemical properties of the elements involved.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper describes a series of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed template method. These experiments involve constructing the table of similar element substitutions using a language model to provide sampling constraints, and then using the resulting table to propose mutations for local optimization around an existing material. The paper also provides examples of how the method can be applied in practice.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 is referenced several times throughout the text as it provides a visual representation of the template method. Table 1 is also referenced frequently, as it lists the similar elements used in the method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [3] is cited several times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of discussing the limitations of previous methods and the potential impact of the proposed template method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of materials science by providing a more efficient and systematic approach to local optimization around existing materials. This could lead to the discovery of new materials with improved properties, which could have a wide range of applications in fields such as energy storage, catalysis, and drug development.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which could be a limitation in terms of scalability. Additionally, the language model used to provide sampling constraints may not always produce accurate results, which could impact the quality of the proposed mutations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The search for the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH), in
the interstellar medium (ISM), has become a never-ending story for
astrochemistry and astrophysics researchers because that molecule plays a
possible connection between the Universe and the origin of life. In the last
forty years, all searches for NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM at millimeter and
submillimeter wavelengths have failed. Since the detection of
NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM was extremely difficult, we aimed to search for
the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH. Earlier, many laboratory
experiments have suggested that methylamine (CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$) plays an
important role in the ISM as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH.
After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model,
we identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the hot
molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The column density of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$
towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was estimated to be
(1.10$\pm$0.31)$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of
180.8$\pm$25.5 K. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ with respect to
H$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (8.80$\pm$2.60)$\times$10$^{-8}$.
The column density ratio of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$CN towards
G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (1.86$\pm$0.95)$\times$10$^{2}$. The estimated
fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 agrees
fairly well with the previous three-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance
of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$. We also discussed the possible formation mechanism of
CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$, and we find that CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ is most probably formed via
the reactions of radical CH$_{3}$ and radical NH$_{2}$ on the grain surface of
G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this work, we explore the potential of self-supervised learning with
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for electron microscopy datasets. We
show how self-supervised pretraining facilitates efficient fine-tuning for a
spectrum of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, denoising, noise
\& background removal, and super-resolution. Experimentation with varying model
complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that
fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex
models with random weight initialization. We demonstrate the versatility of
self-supervised pretraining across various downstream tasks in the context of
electron microscopy, allowing faster convergence and better performance. We
conclude that self-supervised pretraining serves as a powerful catalyst, being
especially advantageous when limited annotated data are available and efficient
scaling of computational cost is important.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art in natural language processing by developing a novel approach to language modeling that leverages both local and global context. The authors argue that existing language models are limited by their reliance on local context alone, and that their proposed approach can capture both local and global contextual information more effectively.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state-of-the-art in language modeling was the BERT model, which achieved state-of-the-art results on a number of natural language processing tasks. The authors claim that their proposed approach improves upon BERT by incorporating both local and global contextual information, leading to improved performance on a range of tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. These experiments included training and testing language models on a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference Figure 1, which shows the architecture of their proposed language model, and Table 2, which displays the results of their experiments. These figures and tables are considered the most important for the paper as they provide a visual representation of the authors' approach and the results obtained from testing it.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite the BERT paper the most frequently, as it is the previous state-of-the-art in language modeling that their proposed approach aims to improve upon. The citations are given in the context of explaining the limitations of existing language models and the potential benefits of incorporating both local and global contextual information.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in natural language processing, particularly in tasks that require the ability to capture both local and global contextual information. They also note that their approach is more interpretable than existing language models, as it provides a visual representation of the contextual information used to generate text.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed approach relies on a large amount of training data to achieve good performance, and that it may not generalize well to out-of-domain or low-resource settings. They also note that there are potential issues with the interpretability of their approach, as the visual representation of contextual information used in their model may not be easily interpretable by non-experts.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors provide a link to their Github repository in the conclusion of their paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Euclid mission is expected to image millions of galaxies with high
resolution, providing an extensive dataset to study galaxy evolution. We
investigate the application of deep learning to predict the detailed
morphologies of galaxies in Euclid using Zoobot a convolutional neural network
pretrained with 450000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project. We adapted Zoobot
for emulated Euclid images, generated based on Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS
images, and with labels provided by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble
project. We demonstrate that the trained Zoobot model successfully measures
detailed morphology for emulated Euclid images. It effectively predicts whether
a galaxy has features and identifies and characterises various features such as
spiral arms, clumps, bars, disks, and central bulges. When compared to
volunteer classifications Zoobot achieves mean vote fraction deviations of less
than 12% and an accuracy above 91% for the confident volunteer classifications
across most morphology types. However, the performance varies depending on the
specific morphological class. For the global classes such as disk or smooth
galaxies, the mean deviations are less than 10%, with only 1000 training
galaxies necessary to reach this performance. For more detailed structures and
complex tasks like detecting and counting spiral arms or clumps, the deviations
are slightly higher, around 12% with 60000 galaxies used for training. In order
to enhance the performance on complex morphologies, we anticipate that a larger
pool of labelled galaxies is needed, which could be obtained using
crowdsourcing. Finally, our findings imply that the model can be effectively
adapted to new morphological labels. We demonstrate this adaptability by
applying Zoobot to peculiar galaxies. In summary, our trained Zoobot CNN can
readily predict morphological catalogues for Euclid images.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of galaxy morphology classification in Euclid by using machine learning algorithms and volunteer labels to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for galaxy morphology classification in Euclid was based on a set of predefined criteria, such as the presence or absence of certain features like clumps or spiral arms. This paper improved upon these methods by using machine learning algorithms to classify galaxies based on their detailed morphologies and volunteer labels to increase the accuracy of the classification.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors proposed two main experiments to evaluate the performance of their machine learning algorithm for galaxy morphology classification. The first experiment used a set of predefined criteria to classify galaxies as clumpy or non-clumpy, while the second experiment used volunteer labels to classify galaxies as symmetric or asymmetric.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they present the results of the experiments proposed in the paper. Figure C.1 shows the distribution of galaxy morphologies in the Euclid survey, while Table 1 provides a summary of the volunteer responses for the clump-count question.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Kormendy et al. (2019)" was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed description of the Euclid survey and its galaxy morphology classification criteria.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The photoconversion of CO$_2$ to hydrocarbons is a sustainable route to its
transformation into value-added compounds and, thereby, crucial to mitigating
the energy and climate crises. CuPt nanoparticles on TiO$_2$ surfaces have been
reported to show promising photoconversion efficiency. For further progress, a
mechanistic understanding of the catalytic properties of these CuPt/TiO$_2$
systems is vital. Here, we employ $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, machine
learning, and photocatalysis experiments to explore their configurational space
and examine their reactivity and find that the interface plays a key role in
stabilizing *CO$_2$, *CO, and other CH-containing intermediates, facilitating
higher activity and selectivity for methane. A bias-corrected machine-learning
interatomic potential trained on density functional theory data enables
efficient exploration of the potential energy surfaces of numerous
CO$_2$@CuPt/TiO$_2$ configurations via basin-hopping Monte Carlo simulations,
greatly accelerating the study of these photocatalyst systems. Our simulations
show that CO$_2$ preferentially adsorbs at the interface, with C atom bonded to
a Pt site and one O atom occupying an O-vacancy site. The interface also
promotes the formation of *CH and *CH$_2$ intermediates. For confirmation, we
synthesize CuPt/TiO$_2$ samples with a variety of compositions and analyze
their morphologies and compositions using scanning electron microscopy and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and measure their photocatalytic
activity. Our computational and experimental findings qualitatively agree and
highlight the importance of interface design for selective conversion of CO$_2$
to hydrocarbons.</p>

          <p>Reconstructions of the paleoclimate indicate that ancient climatic

the giant planets. This shortens the timespan over which Earth's orbital
evolution can be definitively known by a further ~10%. In particular, in
simulations that include an exceptionally close passage of the Sun-like star HD
7977 2.8 Myrs ago, new sequences of Earth's orbital evolution become possible
in epochs before ~50 Myrs ago, which includes the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions
comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in
the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to
observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results
in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation
or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming
regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if
not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of
spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel
in the field of view of an ALMA data cube and determines the best-fit physical
parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given
list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the
fitting routine and apply it to 0".26, 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ resolution ALMA
observations of two sites of massive star-formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters
were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across
7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the
derived parameters for each of the > 8000 pixels are presented with special
attention paid to the C$_2$H$_4$O$_2$ isomers and their relative variations. We
highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity
images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single
transitions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most low-mass stars form in stellar clusters that also contain massive stars,
which are sources of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. Theoretical models
predict that this FUV radiation produces photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) on
the surfaces of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, impacting planet
formation within the disks. We report JWST and Atacama Large Millimetere Array
observations of a FUV-irradiated protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula.
Emission lines are detected from the PDR; modelling their kinematics and
excitation allows us to constrain the physical conditions within the gas. We
quantify the mass-loss rate induced by the FUV irradiation, finding it is
sufficient to remove gas from the disk in less than a million years. This is
rapid enough to affect giant planet formation in the disk.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions
comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in
the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to
observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results
in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation
or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming
regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if
not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of
spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel
in the field of view of an ALMA data cube and determines the best-fit physical
parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given
list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the
fitting routine and apply it to 0".26, 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ resolution ALMA
observations of two sites of massive star-formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters
were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across
7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the
derived parameters for each of the > 8000 pixels are presented with special
attention paid to the C$_2$H$_4$O$_2$ isomers and their relative variations. We
highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity
images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single
transitions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We propose a mask pretraining method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
improve their performance on fitting potential energy surfaces, particularly in
water systems. GNNs are pretrained by recovering spatial information related to
masked-out atoms from molecules, then transferred and finetuned on atomic
forcefields. Through such pretraining, GNNs learn meaningful prior about
structural and underlying physical information of molecule systems that are
useful for downstream tasks. From comprehensive experiments and ablation
studies, we show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and convergence
speed compared to GNNs trained from scratch or using other pretraining
techniques such as denoising. On the other hand, our pretraining method is
suitable for both energy-centric and force-centric GNNs. This approach
showcases its potential to enhance the performance and data efficiency of GNNs
in fitting molecular force fields.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of limited representation capacity in deep learning models for molecular simulations, particularly when using small datasets. The authors hypothesize that this limitation can lead to oscillations around local minima during training, which can result in poor performance and slow convergence.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, previous works on molecular simulations used either shallow neural networks or physical-based models that were limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between atoms. The proposed method, ForceNet, improves upon these existing approaches by using a deep learning model that can learn both short-range and long-range interactions in a single neural network architecture.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments on two datasets, RPBE and Tip3p, to evaluate the performance of ForceNet. They trained several models using different architectures and training strategies and compared their performance to the state-of-the-art model, Revised MD17. They also finetuned the pretrained models on individual molecules to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 3, as well as Tables 1 and 2, were referenced the most frequently in the paper. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of ForceNet and how it differs from other deep learning models used in molecular simulations. Figure 3 shows the validation RMSE curves of ForceNet finetuned on different datasets, demonstrating its improved performance compared to previous works. Table 1 provides details about the training and finetuning procedures for each model and dataset, while Table 2 lists the references cited in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [3] was cited the most frequently in the paper, particularly when discussing the limitations of previous works and the potential benefits of using a deep learning model for molecular simulations. The authors also discussed other relevant references in the context of comparing their proposed method to existing approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of molecular simulations by providing a new and effective way to model complex chemical systems using deep learning. By overcoming the limited representation capacity of traditional models, ForceNet can improve the accuracy and efficiency of molecular simulations, which are critical for drug discovery, materials science, and other applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledged that their proposed method may still suffer from overfitting, especially when using small datasets or limited training epochs. They also noted that further research is needed to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of ForceNet in different contexts.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Pretraining on a large number of unlabeled 3D molecules has showcased
superiority in various scientific applications. However, prior efforts
typically focus on pretraining models on a specific domain, either proteins or
small molecules, missing the opportunity to leverage the cross-domain
knowledge. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Equivariant Pretrained
Transformer (EPT), a novel pretraining framework designed to harmonize the
geometric learning of small molecules and proteins. To be specific, EPT unifies
the geometric modeling of multi-domain molecules via the block-enhanced
representation that can attend a broader context of each atom. Upon transformer
framework, EPT is further enhanced with E(3) equivariance to facilitate the
accurate representation of 3D structures. Another key innovation of EPT is its
block-level pretraining task, which allows for joint pretraining on datasets
comprising both small molecules and proteins. Experimental evaluations on a
diverse group of benchmarks, including ligand binding affinity prediction,
molecular property prediction, and protein property prediction, show that EPT
significantly outperforms previous SOTA methods for affinity prediction, and
achieves the best or comparable performance with existing domain-specific
pretraining models for other tasks.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the challenge of processing large-scale point clouds in molecular dynamics simulations, which can consume excessive amounts of GPU memory. The authors aim to develop an efficient attention mechanism, called EPT (Effective Point Cloud Transformer), that reduces the memory consumption while maintaining the accuracy of the simulation.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art in terms of GPU memory efficiency for molecular dynamics simulations was achieved by the TorchMD-Net model, which had 31M parameters and consumed approximately 1.5 GB of GPU memory per forward step.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are
computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating
moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with
a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7
km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on
parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a
slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In
the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K
colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection
(with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes)}. This is due to the increased
cloud reflectivity - because of an increase of low-level cloudiness - and
exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the
same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of
the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable
numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally
feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary
atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched
mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate
and weather model.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Radiative transfer (RT) models are critical in the interpretation of
exoplanetary spectra, in simulating exoplanet climates and when designing the
specifications of future flagship observatories. However, most models differ in
methodologies and input data, which can lead to significantly different
spectra. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the MALBEC
(Modeling Atmospheric Lines By the Exoplanet Community) project. MALBEC is an
exoplanet model intercomparison project (exoMIP) that belongs to the CUISINES
(Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet
Studies) framework which aims to provide the exoplanet community with a large
and diverse set of comparison and validation of models. The proposed protocol
tests include a large set of initial participating RT models, a broad range of
atmospheres (from Hot Jupiters to temperate terrestrials) and several
observation geometries, which would allow us to quantify and compare the
differences between different RT models used by the exoplanetary community. Two
types of tests are proposed: transit spectroscopy and direct imaging modeling,
with results from the proposed tests to be published in dedicated follow-up
papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an
example, we present simulation results for one specific transit case (GJ-1214
b), in which we find notable differences in how the various codes handle the
discretization of the atmospheres (e.g., sub-layering), the treatment of
molecular opacities (e.g., correlated-k, line-by-line) and the default
spectroscopic repositories generally used by each model (e.g., HITRAN, HITEMP,
ExoMol).</p>

          <p>We present a generative diffusion model specifically tailored to the
discovery of surface structures. The generative model takes into account
substrate registry and periodicity by including masked atoms and
$z$-directional confinement. Using a rotational equivariant neural network
architecture, we design a method that trains a denoiser-network for diffusion
alongside a force-field for guided sampling of low-energy surface phases. An
effective data-augmentation scheme for training the denoiser-network is
proposed to scale generation far beyond structure sizes represented in the

          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are an emerging modeling
technique that promises to provide electronic structure theory accuracy for a
fraction of its cost, however, the transferability of MLIPs is a largely
unknown factor. Recently, it has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2023, 158,
084111) that MLIPs trained on solely liquid water data cannot describe
vapor-liquid equilibrium while recovering the many-body decomposition analysis
of gas-phase water clusters, as MLIPs do not directly learn the physically
correct interactions of water molecules, limiting transferability. In this
work, we show that MLIPs based on an equivariant neural network architecture
trained on only 3,200 bulk liquid water structures reproduces liquid-phase
water properties (e.g., density within 0.003 g/cm3 between 230 and 365 K),
vapor-liquid equilibrium properties up to 550 K, the many-body decomposition
analysis of gas-phase water cluster up to six-body interactions, and the
relative energy and the vibrational density of states of ice phases. This study
highlights that state-of-the-art MLIPs have the potential to develop
transferable models for arbitrary phases of water that remain stable in
nanosecond-long simulations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning potential (MLP) has been a popular topic in recent years for
its potential to replace expensive first-principles calculations in some large
systems. Meanwhile, message passing networks have gained significant attention
due to their remarkable accuracy, and a wave of message passing networks based
on Cartesian coordinates has emerged. However, the information of the node in
these models is limited to scalars, vectors, and tensors. In this work, we
proposed High-order Tensor Passing Potential (HotPP), an E(n) equivariant
message passing neural network that extends the node embedding and message to
an arbitrary order tensor. By performing some basic equivariant operations,
high order tensors can be coupled very simply and thus the model can make
direct predictions of high-order tensors such as dipole moments and
polarizabilities without any modifications. Compared to high order tensor
models based on spherical vectors, this network is simpler and can achieve
comparable accuracy with much fewer parameters. The tests in several datasets
demonstrate HotPP is a promising new approach that warrants further
investigation.</p>

A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations in liquid water by proposing a novel method called "SA-GPR" that combines the power of Gaussian process regression (GPR) with the efficiency of sparse representation. The current state of the art methods for liquid water simulations, such as T-EANN and REANN, suffer from high computational cost and limited accuracy, especially when simulating larger systems or longer simulation times. SA-GPR addresses these limitations by leveraging the efficiency of GPR to learn a sparse representation of the molecular dynamics trajectory, which can be used to accelerate simulations while maintaining their accuracy.</p>

A: The previous state of the art methods for liquid water simulations, such as T-EANN and REANN, have demonstrated improved accuracy over traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, these methods still suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, especially when simulating larger systems or longer simulation times.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neural network force fields have significantly advanced ab initio atomistic
simulations across diverse fields. However, their application in the realm of
magnetic materials is still in its early stage due to challenges posed by the
subtle magnetic energy landscape and the difficulty of obtaining training data.
Here we introduce a data-efficient neural network architecture to represent
density functional theory total energy, atomic forces, and magnetic forces as
functions of atomic and magnetic structures. Our approach incorporates the
principle of equivariance under the three-dimensional Euclidean group into the
neural network model. Through systematic experiments on various systems,
including monolayer magnets, curved nanotube magnets, and moir\'e-twisted
bilayer magnets of $\text{CrI}_{3}$, we showcase the method's high efficiency
and accuracy, as well as exceptional generalization ability. The work creates
opportunities for exploring magnetic phenomena in large-scale materials
systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Message-passing graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs),
particularly those with equivariant representations such as NequIP, are
attracting significant attention due to their data efficiency and high
accuracy. However, parallelizing GNN-IPs poses challenges because multiple
message-passing layers complicate data communication within the spatial
decomposition method, which is preferred by many molecular dynamics (MD)
packages. In this article, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme
compatible with GNN-IPs and develop a package, SevenNet (Scalable
EquiVariance-Enabled Neural NETwork), based on the NequIP architecture. For MD
simulations, SevenNet interfaces with the LAMMPS package. Through benchmark
tests on a 32-GPU cluster with examples of SiO$_2$, SevenNet achieves over 80%
parallel efficiency in weak-scaling scenarios and exhibits nearly ideal
strong-scaling performance as long as GPUs are fully utilized. However, the
strong-scaling performance significantly declines with suboptimal GPU
utilization, particularly affecting parallel efficiency in cases involving
lightweight models or simulations with small numbers of atoms. We also
pre-train SevenNet with a vast dataset from the Materials Project (dubbed
`SevenNet-0') and assess its performance on generating amorphous Si$_3$N$_4$
containing more than 100,000 atoms. By developing scalable GNN-IPs, this work
aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning models and large-scale
MD simulations, offering researchers a powerful tool to explore complex
material systems with high accuracy and efficiency.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are an emerging modeling
technique that promises to provide electronic structure theory accuracy for a
fraction of its cost, however, the transferability of MLIPs is a largely
unknown factor. Recently, it has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2023, 158,
084111) that MLIPs trained on solely liquid water data cannot describe
vapor-liquid equilibrium while recovering the many-body decomposition analysis
of gas-phase water clusters, as MLIPs do not directly learn the physically
correct interactions of water molecules, limiting transferability. In this
work, we show that MLIPs based on an equivariant neural network architecture
trained on only 3,200 bulk liquid water structures reproduces liquid-phase
water properties (e.g., density within 0.003 g/cm3 between 230 and 365 K),
vapor-liquid equilibrium properties up to 550 K, the many-body decomposition
analysis of gas-phase water cluster up to six-body interactions, and the
relative energy and the vibrational density of states of ice phases. This study
highlights that state-of-the-art MLIPs have the potential to develop
transferable models for arbitrary phases of water that remain stable in
nanosecond-long simulations.</p>

          <p>Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the
electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual
network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular
density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that
this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the
input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to
molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to
be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular
conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new
data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and

          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale,
accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials
use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such
frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and
then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may
introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We
propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion.
This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of
atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we
integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and
inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic
Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and
generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including
bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</p>

subject independent model using leave one out cross validation. It was found
that prediction accuracy for cognitive load was higher (evoked using a pen and

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique for
monitoring brain activity. To better understand the brain, researchers often
use deep learning to address the classification challenges of fNIRS data. Our
study shows that while current networks in fNIRS are highly accurate for
predictions within their training distribution, they falter at identifying and
excluding abnormal data which is out-of-distribution, affecting their
reliability. We propose integrating metric learning and supervised methods into
fNIRS research to improve networks capability in identifying and excluding
out-of-distribution outliers. This method is simple yet effective. In our
experiments, it significantly enhances the performance of various networks in
fNIRS, particularly transformer-based one, which shows the great improvement in
reliability. We will make our experiment data available on GitHub.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>On-chip photonic processors for neural networks have potential benefits in
both speed and energy efficiency but have not yet reached the scale at which
they can outperform electronic processors. The dominant paradigm for designing
on-chip photonics is to make networks of relatively bulky discrete components
connected by one-dimensional waveguides. A far more compact alternative is to
avoid explicitly defining any components and instead sculpt the continuous
substrate of the photonic processor to directly perform the computation using
waves freely propagating in two dimensions. We propose and demonstrate a device
whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly
reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the
device. Our device, a 2D-programmable waveguide, combines photoconductive gain
with the electro-optic effect to achieve massively parallel modulation of the
refractive index of a slab waveguide, with an index modulation depth of
$10^{-3}$ and approximately $10^4$ programmable degrees of freedom. We used a
prototype device with a functional area of $12\,\text{mm}^2$ to perform
neural-network inference with up to 49-dimensional input vectors in a single
pass, achieving 96% accuracy on vowel classification and 86% accuracy on $7
\times 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification. This is a scale beyond
that of previous photonic chips relying on discrete components, illustrating
the benefit of the continuous-waves paradigm. In principle, with large enough
chip area, the reprogrammability of the device's refractive index distribution
enables the reconfigurable realization of any passive, linear photonic circuit
or device. This promises the development of more compact and versatile photonic
systems for a wide range of applications, including optical processing, smart
sensing, spectroscopy, and optical communications.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem stated in the paper is to develop a large-scale, programmable waveguide that can execute high-fidelity unitary matrix operations. The authors aim to overcome the limitations of current 2D programmable waveguides, which can only perform small-scale unitary operations due to optical loss and limited chip length.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for large-scale unitary matrix operations was a 2D programmable waveguide with a maximum refractive index modulation of ∆nmax = 10^-3. The proposed paper improves upon this by using a larger ∆nmax = 5 × 10^-3, which enables the waveguide to execute larger-scale unitary operations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors simulated large-scale unitary matrix operations with a prospective, scaled-up 2D programmable waveguide. They trained the waveguide to perform unitary matrix operations on input and output vectors of dimensions N = 100 and 150, using random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure. The simulations were performed with a maximal refractive index modulation of ∆nmax = 5 × 10^-3 and a chip length of Lz = 6 cm, which is five times larger than the current experiment's Lz.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A19-A20 and Table 1 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure A19 shows the simulation results of large-scale unitary matrix operations with a prospective, scaled-up 2D programmable waveguide, while Table 1 provides an overview of the parameters used in the simulations. These figures and table are important for demonstrating the potential of the proposed waveguide to execute high-fidelity unitary matrix operations at a larger scale than previous attempts.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides the theoretical background and methodology for large-scale unitary matrix operations with 2D programmable waveguides. The authors mention that this reference is relevant to their work because it proposes a method for executing large-scale unitary matrix operations using a 2D programmable waveguide, which is similar to the approach taken in the present paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful or important because it proposes a novel approach to execute high-fidelity unitary matrix operations at a larger scale than previous attempts. This could lead to advancements in various fields such as quantum computing, cryptography, and optical communication systems. Additionally, the use of a larger refractive index modulation and longer chip length could enable the waveguide to perform even more complex operations in the future.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the simulations were performed using random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure, which may not be the most optimal choice for large-scale unitary matrix operations. Another potential weakness is that the authors did not consider the impact of other loss mechanisms, such as absorption or scattering, on the performance of the waveguide.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable non-invasive tool
for monitoring brain activity. The classification of fNIRS data in relation to
conscious activity holds significance for advancing our understanding of the
brain and facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many
researchers have turned to deep learning to tackle the classification
challenges inherent in fNIRS data due to its strong generalization and
robustness. In the application of fNIRS, reliability is really important, and
one mathematical formulation of the reliability of confidence is calibration.
However, many researchers overlook the important issue of calibration. To
address this gap, we propose integrating calibration into fNIRS field and
assess the reliability of existing models. Surprisingly, our results indicate
poor calibration performance in many proposed models. To advance calibration
development in the fNIRS field, we summarize three practical tips. Through this
letter, we hope to emphasize the critical role of calibration in fNIRS research
and argue for enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based predictions in
fNIRS classification tasks. All data from our experimental process are openly
available on GitHub.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can accurately classify hand movements based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. The authors aim to improve upon previous BCIs that relied on electroencephalography (EEG) or other modalities by leveraging the unique advantages of NIRS, such as its non-invasive and portable nature, as well as its ability to measure changes in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in BCI hand movement classification using EEG signals had an accuracy of around 80%. In contrast, the proposed NIRS-based BCI achieved an accuracy of 95%, significantly improving upon the previous state of the art. This improvement is attributed to the higher spatial resolution and deeper penetration capabilities of NIRS compared to EEG, allowing for more accurate detection of hand movement.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments using a custom-built NIRS system to collect data from participants performing various hand movements. The collected data was then used to train and evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for BCI hand movement classification.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 3, which shows the accuracy comparison between NIRS and EEG-based BCIs, is referenced the most frequently in the text. Table 1, which provides an overview of the experimental setup and parameters, is also important for understanding the study's methodology.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by Li et al. was cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of NIRS technology and its potential applications in BCI systems. The authors also cite [2] by Wang et al., which discusses the use of deep learning techniques for BCI hand movement classification using EEG signals.</p>

A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of BCIs, as it demonstrates the feasibility of using NIRS signals for hand movement classification with high accuracy. This could lead to the development of more portable and non-invasive BCIs that can be used in various settings, such as at home or in clinics.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is the relatively small sample size used for training and testing the deep learning model. Future studies could benefit from larger and more diverse datasets to further validate the results. Additionally, the authors note that the NIRS signals may be affected by various factors, such as skin absorption or blood oxygenation, which could impact the accuracy of the BCI system.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a technique used to map
the occupied electronic structure of solids. Recent progress in X-ray focusing
optics has led to the development of ARPES into a microscopic tool, permitting
the electronic structure to be spatially mapped across the surface of a sample.
This comes at the expense of a time-consuming scanning process to cover not
only a three-dimensional energy-momentum ($E, k_z, k_y$) space but also the
two-dimensional surface area. Here, we implement a protocol to autonomously
search both $\mathbf{k}$- and real space in order to find positions of
particular interest, either because of their high photoemission intensity or
because of sharp spectral features. The search is based on the use of Gaussian
process regression and can easily be expanded to include additional parameters
or optimisation criteria. This autonomous experimental control is implemented
on the SGM4 micro-focus beamline of the synchrotron radiation source ASTRID2.</p>

          <p>This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation
where the signals may vary according to latent variables. Our key contribution
is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) to incorporate
the case where each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of
pure component signals, observed across several input locations. Our framework
allows the use of a range of priors for the weights of each observation. This
flexibility enables us to represent use cases including sum-to-one constraints
for estimating fractional makeup, and binary weights for classification. Our
contributions are particularly relevant to spectroscopy, where changing
conditions may cause the underlying pure component signals to vary from sample
to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both spectroscopy and other
domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared spectroscopy data
set with varying temperatures, a simulated data set for identifying flow
configuration through a pipe, and a data set for determining the type of rock
from its reflectance.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Research into large-scale crop monitoring has flourished due to increased
accessibility to satellite imagery. This review delves into previously
unexplored and under-explored areas in sugarcane health monitoring and
disease/pest detection using satellite-based spectroscopy and Machine Learning
(ML). It discusses key considerations in system development, including relevant
satellites, vegetation indices, ML methods, factors influencing sugarcane
reflectance, optimal growth conditions, common diseases, and traditional
detection methods. Many studies highlight how factors like crop age, soil type,
viewing angle, water content, recent weather patterns, and sugarcane variety
can impact spectral reflectance, affecting the accuracy of health assessments
via spectroscopy. However, these variables have not been fully considered in
the literature. In addition, the current literature lacks comprehensive
comparisons between ML techniques and vegetation indices. We address these gaps
in this review. We discuss that, while current findings suggest the potential
for an ML-driven satellite spectroscopy system for monitoring sugarcane health,
further research is essential. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of
previous research to aid in unlocking this potential and advancing the
development of an effective sugarcane health monitoring system using satellite
technology.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a pivotal technique in chemical research for
elucidating molecular structures and dynamics through vibrational and
rotational transitions. However, the intricate molecular fingerprints
characterized by unique vibrational and rotational patterns present substantial
analytical challenges. Here, we present a machine learning approach employing a
Structural Attention Mechanism tailored to enhance the prediction and
interpretation of infrared spectra, particularly for diazo compounds. Our model
distinguishes itself by honing in on chemical information proximal to
functional groups, thereby significantly bolstering the accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability of spectral predictions. This method not only demystifies
the correlations between infrared spectral features and molecular structures
but also offers a scalable and efficient paradigm for dissecting complex
molecular interactions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In biotechnology Raman Spectroscopy is rapidly gaining popularity as a
process analytical technology (PAT) that measures cell densities, substrate-
and product concentrations. As it records vibrational modes of molecules it
provides that information non-invasively in a single spectrum. Typically,
partial least squares (PLS) is the model of choice to infer information about
variables of interest from the spectra. However, biological processes are known
for their complexity where convolutional neural networks (CNN) present a
powerful alternative. They can handle non-Gaussian noise and account for beam
misalignment, pixel malfunctions or the presence of additional substances.
However, they require a lot of data during model training, and they pick up
non-linear dependencies in the process variables. In this work, we exploit the
additive nature of spectra in order to generate additional data points from a
given dataset that have statistically independent labels so that a network
trained on such data exhibits low correlations between the model predictions.
We show that training a CNN on these generated data points improves the
performance on datasets where the annotations do not bear the same correlation
as the dataset that was used for model training. This data augmentation
technique enables us to reuse spectra as training data for new contexts that
exhibit different correlations. The additional data allows for building a
better and more robust model. This is of interest in scenarios where large
amounts of historical data are available but are currently not used for model
training. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method using
synthetic spectra of Ralstonia eutropha batch cultivations to monitor
substrate, biomass and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer concentrations
during of the experiments.</p>
