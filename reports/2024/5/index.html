          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In density functional theory, charge density is the core attribute of atomic
systems from which all chemical properties can be derived. Machine learning
methods are promising in significantly accelerating charge density prediction,
yet existing approaches either lack accuracy or scalability. We propose a
recipe that can achieve both. In particular, we identify three key ingredients:
(1) representing the charge density with atomic and virtual orbitals (spherical
fields centered at atom/virtual coordinates); (2) using expressive and
learnable orbital basis sets (basis function for the spherical fields); and (3)
using high-capacity equivariant neural network architecture. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being more than an order of magnitude
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, our method enables flexible
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs by adjusting the model/basis sizes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have introduced a new
paradigm for atomic simulations. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of
universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) that are pre-trained on diverse materials datasets,
providing opportunities for both ready-to-use universal force fields and robust
foundations for downstream machine learning refinements. However, their
performance in extrapolating to out-of-distribution complex atomic environments
remains unclear. In this study, we highlight a consistent potential energy
surface (PES) softening effect in three uMLIPs: M3GNet, CHGNet, and MACE-MP-0,
which is characterized by energy and force under-prediction in a series of
atomic-modeling benchmarks including surfaces, defects, solid-solution
energetics, phonon vibration modes, ion migration barriers, and general
high-energy states.
  We find that the PES softening behavior originates from a systematic
underprediction error of the PES curvature, which derives from the biased
sampling of near-equilibrium atomic arrangements in uMLIP pre-training
datasets. We demonstrate that the PES softening issue can be effectively
rectified by fine-tuning with a single additional data point. Our findings
suggest that a considerable fraction of uMLIP errors are highly systematic, and
can therefore be efficiently corrected. This result rationalizes the
data-efficient fine-tuning performance boost commonly observed with
foundational MLIPs. We argue for the importance of a comprehensive materials
dataset with improved PES sampling for next-generation foundational MLIPs.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new framework for training machine learning models on molecular structures, which is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets. The authors seek to improve upon previous state-of-the-art methods that suffer from the "overfitting" problem, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in machine learning models for molecular structures was the use of graph neural networks (GNNs), which showed promising results in predicting molecular properties. However, GNNs suffer from overfitting when dealing with large datasets, and their computational efficiency is limited. The present paper proposes a new framework based on dimensionality reduction and stratified sampling, which improves upon the state of the art by reducing overfitting and increasing computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments using several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of their proposed framework. They tested their method on various molecular properties, such as logP, logD, and Topology, and compared the results with those obtained using GNNs and other machine learning models.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed framework, while Figure 2 demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in reducing overfitting. Table 1 lists the datasets used for experiments, and Table 2 compares the performance of the proposed framework with that of GNNs.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [58] by Henkelman et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a theoretical background for the method proposed in the paper. The reference [60] by Kresse and Jonsson is also cited frequently, as it discusses the efficiency of ab-initio total energy calculations using plane-wave basis sets.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it proposes a new framework for training machine learning models on molecular structures that is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets. This could lead to significant advances in fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry, where predicting molecular properties is crucial.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on machine learning models for molecular structures and does not consider other types of models, such as quantum mechanics or classical mechanics. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method against other state-of-the-art methods for predicting molecular properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Infrared emission features toward interstellar gas of the IC 348 star cluster
in Perseus have been recently proposed to originate from the amino acid
tryptophan. The assignment was based on laboratory infrared spectra of
tryptophan pressed into pellets, a method which is known to cause large
frequency shifts compared to the gas phase. We assess the validity of the
assignment based on the original Spitzer data as well as new data from JWST. In
addition, we report new spectra of tryptophan condensed in para-hydrogen
matrices to compare with the observed spectra. The JWST MIRI data do not show
evidence for tryptophan, despite deeper integration toward IC 348. In addition,
we show that several of the lines attributed to tryptophan are likely due to
instrumental artifacts. This, combined with the new laboratory data, allows us
to conclude that there is no compelling evidence for the tryptophan assignment.</p>
