          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized
quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological
radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations,
including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable
IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar
IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is
critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic
fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star
formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy
IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches)
in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then
dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales
~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept
up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong
tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape
depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as
the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (< yr) and tidal fields
are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular
momentum or fragment catastrophically at <10 au scales requires novel PSD
simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with
planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs,
though we discuss a couple of viable models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies and to understand how these properties vary with galaxy properties, including mass, size, and environment. They also seek to determine whether there are any correlations between the molecular gas properties and other galaxy properties, such as the amount of stellar mass or the presence of a central bar.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies was limited by the availability of high-quality observational data and the lack of a comprehensive framework for analyzing these data. This paper improves upon previous studies by using a large, homogeneous dataset of CO(2-1) observations from the HERA and ASTE telescopes, combined with a novel analysis method that accounts for the effects of beam smearing and the presence of multiple velocity components in the molecular gas.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed a large-scale survey of nearby star-forming galaxies using a uniform observational protocol to measure the CO(2-1) emission line. They also developed a novel analysis method that accounts for the effects of beam smearing and the presence of multiple velocity components in the molecular gas.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a overview of the sample selection, the molecular gas properties, and the correlation between molecular gas and galaxy properties, respectively. Table 2 is also important as it presents the summary of the molecular gas properties for the entire sample.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Tremaine 2001) is cited several times in the paper, particularly when discussing the previous state of the art in studying molecular gas properties. The authors also cite (Wada et al. 1994, 2009) and (Banerjee et al. 2011) to support their claims about the molecular gas properties and the correlation between molecular gas and galaxy properties, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful as it provides a comprehensive analysis of the molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies, which is essential for understanding the role of molecular gas in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The novel analysis method developed in this paper can also be applied to other observational datasets, providing a new way of studying molecular gas properties in galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a limited sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, which may not be representative of all galaxies. Additionally, the analysis method developed in this paper assumes that the molecular gas is in local thermal equilibrium, which may not always be the case.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to the Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for detecting and characterizing interstellar dust grains in the Milky Way's inner galaxy using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). They seek to improve upon current methods, which are limited by their reliance on model-based techniques and low signal-to-noise ratios.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting interstellar dust grains involved using radio astronomy observations to constrain the size distribution of dust grains. However, these methods were limited by their reliance on model-based techniques and low signal-to-noise ratios. This paper improves upon these methods by using ALMA observations to directly detect and characterize dust grains, without relying on models or assumptions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used ALMA observations of the 1.3 mm emission line of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the inner galaxy to detect and characterize interstellar dust grains. They applied a novel analysis method, which combines wavelet analysis and machine learning techniques, to identify and classify dust grains based on their spectral energy distribution (SED).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, 3, and Tables 1-3 were referenced most frequently in the text. Figure 1 presents the observed SEDs of dust grains in the inner galaxy, while Figure 2 shows the resulting dust maps after applying the novel analysis method. Table 1 lists the properties of the observed dust grains, while Table 2 compares the results of this paper with previous studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: Reference [87] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed analysis of the NaCl emission line and its use in dust studies. The citation is given in the context of explaining the observed SEDs of dust grains in the inner galaxy.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of interstellar dust grains and their distribution in the Milky Way's inner galaxy. By directly detecting and characterizing dust grains using ALMA observations, this study provides a more accurate and detailed picture of the dust population than previous methods. This could have important implications for understanding the physics of dust grain formation and evolution, as well as the effects of dust on the galaxy's overall structure and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of this paper is that it relies on a relatively small sample size of observations, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the novel analysis method used in this study may not be applicable to other astronomical sources or observational datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>FIR and submm observations have established the fundamental role of
dust-obscured star formation in the assembly of stellar mass over the past 12
billion years. At z between 2 and 4, the bulk of star formation is enshrouded
in dust, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) contain about half of the
total stellar mass density. Star formation develops in dense molecular clouds,
and is regulated by a complex interplay between all the ISM components that
contribute to the energy budget of a galaxy: gas, dust, cosmic rays,
interstellar electromagnetic fields, gravitational field, dark matter.
Molecular gas is the actual link between star forming gas and its complex
environment, providing by far the richest amount of information about the star
formation process. However, molecular lines interpretation requires complex
modeling of astrochemical networks, which regulate the molecular formation and
establishes molecular abundances in a cloud, and a modeling of the physical
conditions of the gas in which molecular energy levels become populated. This
paper critically reviews the main astrochemical parameters needed to get
predictions about molecular signals in DSFGs. We review the current knowledge
and the open questions about the interstellar medium of DSFGs, outlying the key
role of molecular gas as a tracer and shaper of the star formation process.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the main problems in astrochemistry is determining the amount of
sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the interstellar medium. The detection
of the main sulfur reservoirs (icy H$_2$S and atomic gas) has been challenging,
and estimates are based on the reliability of models to account for the
abundances of species containing less than 1% of the total sulfur. The high
sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope provides an unprecedented
opportunity to estimate the sulfur abundance through the observation of the [S
I] 25.249 $\mu$m line. We used the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m, and
[S l] 25.249 $\mu$m lines to estimate the amount of sulfur in the ionized and
molecular gas along the Orion Bar. For the theoretical part, we used an
upgraded version of the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code to model the
observations. New inelastic collision rates of neutral atomic sulfur with
ortho- and para- molecular hydrogen were calculated to predict the line
intensities. The [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m and [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m lines are detected
over the imaged region with a shallow increase (by a factor of 4) toward the
HII region. We estimate a moderate sulfur depletion, by a factor of $\sim$2, in
the ionized gas. The corrugated interface between the molecular and atomic
phases gives rise to several edge-on dissociation fronts we refer to as DF1,
DF2, and DF3. The [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only detected toward DF2 and DF3,
the dissociation fronts located farthest from the HII region. The detailed
modeling of DF3 using the Meudon PDR code shows that the emission of the [S l]
25.249 $\mu$m line is coming from warm ($>$ 40 K) molecular gas located at
A$_{\rm V}$ $\sim$ 1$-$5 mag from the ionization front. Moreover, the intensity
of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only accounted for if we assume the presence
of undepleted sulfur.</p>

However, these methods are limited by their inability to account for the effects of dust on the observed light. The current study proposes a new algorithm that takes into account the thermal emission and scattering properties of dust, improving upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate detection and characterization of exoplanets.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced frequently throughout the paper. Figure 1 shows the wavelength dependence of the dust scattering cross section, while Table 1 lists the parameters used in the simulations. Figure 2 demonstrates the impact of dust on the transit signal, and Table 2 compares the results of the new algorithm with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of dust on exoplanet detection and characterization. The authors also cite [2-4] to support their claims about the limitations of current methods and the potential of the new algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our ability to detect and characterize exoplanets, particularly those in the habitable zone around G-type stars. By taking into account the effects of dust on the observed light, the new algorithm could provide more accurate estimates of exoplanet masses, sizes, and compositions, which are crucial for understanding the potential for life.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach assumes a uniform dust composition and geometry, which may not be realistic in all cases. Additionally, they note that further improvements to the algorithm could involve incorporating more sophisticated models of dust properties and observing conditions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently
been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The
photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated
multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are
done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the
three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network
method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full
dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The
wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the
number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious
states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a
projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in
astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a
lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the
recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in
understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be
captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been
developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms
driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is
still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction
networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal
transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and
products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median
structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier
height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD
and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25% through pretraining
React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory,
GFN2-xTB. We envision the great accuracy and fast inference of React-OT useful
in targeting TSs when exploring chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the first systematic investigation of supervised scaling laws
outside of an ImageNet-like context - on images of galaxies. We use 840k galaxy
images and over 100M annotations by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, comparable in scale
to Imagenet-1K. We find that adding annotated galaxy images provides a power
law improvement in performance across all architectures and all tasks, while
adding trainable parameters is effective only for some (typically more
subjectively challenging) tasks. We then compare the downstream performance of
finetuned models pretrained on either ImageNet-12k alone vs. additionally
pretrained on our galaxy images. We achieve an average relative error rate
reduction of 31% across 5 downstream tasks of scientific interest. Our
finetuned models are more label-efficient and, unlike their
ImageNet-12k-pretrained equivalents, often achieve linear transfer performance
equal to that of end-to-end finetuning. We find relatively modest additional
downstream benefits from scaling model size, implying that scaling alone is not
sufficient to address our domain gap, and suggest that practitioners with
qualitatively different images might benefit more from in-domain adaption
followed by targeted downstream labelling.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and
properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic
nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their
dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic
microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals
(NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting
of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully
disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent
fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the
colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of
densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due
to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase,
which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with
simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains
the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via
XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to
elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and
other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and
non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for understanding coarsening rates in superlattices was limited to modeling the effect of temperature and composition, but not the driving force.

          <p>Optical Bound States in the Continuum are peculiar localized states within
the continuous spectrum that are unaffected by any far-field radiation and
intrinsic absorption, therefore possessing infinite mode lifetime and Q-factor.
To date they have been widely studied in dielectric structures whereas their
exploitation in lossy media, i.e. plasmonic nanostructures, still remains a
challenge. Here, we show the emergence of a hybrid BIC state in a 2D system of
silver-filled dimers, quasi-embedded in a high-index dielectric waveguide. The
hybrid BIC onset is found to be highly dependent on the bare modes' spectral
and spatial overlap, but particularly on the plasmonic field's intensity. By
tailoring the hybridizing plasmonic/photonic fractions we select an ideal
coupling regime for which the mode exhibits both, high Q-factor values and
strong near-field enhancement tightly confined in the nanogap and a
consequently extremely small modal volume. We demonstrate that this optical
layout can be exploited in a proof-of-concept experiment for the detection of
TAR DNA-binding protein 43, which outperforms the sensitivity of current
label-free biosensing platforms, reaching the zeptomolar range of
concentration.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact
on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting
the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a
promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure
prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and
first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of
deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize
pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present
AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant
inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures.
AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal
material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By
leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal
structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability
in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights
the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design
of new materials with tailored properties.</p>

perform peptide synthesis under conditions prevailing in space and provide a

allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds
due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C +
CO + NH3 reaction. Here, we address the question of how the efficiency of
peptide production is modified by the presence of water molecules. We
demonstrate that although water slightly reduces the efficiency of

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain
both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups,
which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the
universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is
known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all
surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the
star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter
wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of
NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify
NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments
have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible
precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the
Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the
rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core
G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density
of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$
with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the
rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to
H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived
abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up
chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible
formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and
we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase
reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to detect and characterize possible precursors of glycine, a crucial amino acid in the interstellar medium (ISM), using observations of molecular lines. They specifically target methanimine (CH2NH) and hydrogenation of solid hydrogen cyanide HCN at low temperatures, which are potential precursors of glycine.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting and characterizing possible precursors of glycine involved observations of molecular lines in the Orion Nebula, but the results were limited due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and the absence of high-quality spectra. This paper improves upon these observations by using a new instrument, CASSIS, which provides higher spectral resolution and improved S/N ratios, allowing for more accurate detection and characterization of molecular lines.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used the CASSIS instrument to observe molecular lines in the Sagittarius B2(M) star-forming region at 350 GHz, which is a suitable frequency range for detecting methanimine (CH2NH) and hydrogenation of solid hydrogen cyanide HCN. They also performed simulations to evaluate the potential impact of different parameters on the observed spectra.</p>

          <p>Understanding the large-scale three-dimensional structure of the inner
heliosphere, while important in its own right, is crucial for space weather
applications, such as forecasting the time of arrival and propagation of
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This study uses sunRunner3D (3D), a 3-D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, to simulate solar wind (SW) streams and
generate background states. SR3D employs the boundary conditions generated by
CORona-HELiosphere (CORHEL) and the PLUTO code to compute the plasma properties
of the SW with the MHD approximation up to 1.1 AU in the inner heliosphere. We
demonstrate that SR3D reproduces global features of Corotating Interaction
Regions (CIRs) observed by Earth-based spacecraft (OMNI) and the Solar
TErrestial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A for a set of Carrington rotations
(CRs) that cover a period that lays in the late declining phase of solar cycle
24. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model solutions are valid in the
corotating and inertial frames of references. Moreover, a comparison between
SR3D simulations and in-situ measurements shows reasonable agreement with the
observations, and our results are comparable to those achieved by Predictive
Science Inc.'s Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code. We
have also undertaken a comparative analysis with the Space Weather Adaptive
Simulation Framework for Solar Wind (SWASTi-SW), a PLUTO physics-based model,
to evaluate the precision of various initial boundary conditions. Finally, we
discuss the disparities in the solutions derived from inertial and rotating

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main
sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed. These discoveries
have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems,
revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common
in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar
system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now
moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits)
towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With
improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology
of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in
our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the
geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major
challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we
may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In
the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky
planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the
implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal
atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term
geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including
whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle
can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping
through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the
current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and
evolution.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked
and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal
strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for
variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral
content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as
resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year
period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible
with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is
frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on
an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the
Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar
cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which
is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed
spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has
been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible
to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single
frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year
period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely
with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate
variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal
spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method
to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate
records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar
cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and
assessing the Sun climate connection.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly influence the properties and performance of
materials, emphasizing the importance of understanding the GB structure and
phase behavior. As recent computational studies have demonstrated the existence
of multiple GB phases associated with varying the atomic density at the
interface, we introduce a validated, open-source GRand canonical Interface
Predictor (GRIP) tool that automates high-throughput, grand canonical
optimization of GB structures. While previous studies of GB phases have almost
exclusively focused on cubic systems, we demonstrate the utility of GRIP in an
application to hexagonal close-packed titanium. We perform a systematic
high-throughput exploration of tilt GBs in titanium and discover previously
unreported structures and phase transitions. In low-angle boundaries, we
demonstrate a coupling between point defect absorption and the change in the GB
dislocation network topology due to GB phase transformations, which has
important implications for the accommodation of radiation-induced defects.</p>

          <p>We describe recent spectroscopic observations of red giant stars made by the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble
Space Telescope, which have provided spatially resolved observations of the
warm chromospheric winds that predominate for early K to mid-M giants. The H I
Lyman-alpha lines of a set of 11 red giants observed with the STIS/E140M
echelle grating are first analyzed to ascertain wind H I column densities and
total wind mass-loss rates. The M giants have estimated mass-loss rates of
Mdot=(14-86)e-11 Msun/yr, while the K giants with detected wind absorption have
weaker winds with Mdot=(1.5-2.8)e-11 Msun/yr. We use long-slit spectra of H I
Lyman-alpha for two particular red giants, Alpha Tau (K5 III) and Gamma Cru
(M3.5 III), to study the spatial extent of the Lyman-alpha emission. From these
data we estimate limits for the extent of detectable emission, which are r=193
Rstar for Gamma Cru and r=44 Rstar for Alpha Tau. Cross-dispersion emission
profiles in the STIS echelle spectra of the larger sample of red giants also
show evidence for spatial resolution, not only for H I Lyman-alpha but for
other lines with visible wind absorption, such as Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, O I, and
C II. We characterize the nature of these spatial signatures. The spatial
extent is far more apparent for the M giants than for the K giants, consistent
with the stronger winds found for the M giants from the Lyman-alpha analysis.</p>

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of solar wind charge exchange modeling by providing a more accurate and efficient way to simulate these events. This could help improve our understanding of the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth's magnetic field, which are crucial for space weather forecasting and protecting spacecraft from harmful radiation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>At centimeter wavelengths, single-dish observations have suggested that the
Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 molecular cloud at the Galactic Center hosts weak maser
emission from several organic molecules, including CH$_2$NH, HNCNH, and
HCOOCH$_3$. However, the lack of spatial distribution information of these new
maser species has prevented us from assessing the excitation conditions of the
maser emission as well as their pumping mechanisms. Here, we present a mapping
study toward Sgr B2 North (N) to locate the region where the complex maser
emission originates. We report the first detection of the Class I methanol
(CH$_3$OH) maser at 84 GHz and the first interferometric map of the methanimine
(CH$_2$NH) maser at 5.29 GHz toward this region. In addition, we present a tool
for modeling and fitting the unsaturated molecular maser signals with non-LTE
radiative transfer models and Bayesian analysis using the Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo approach. These enable us to quantitatively assess the observed spectral
profiles. The results suggest a two-chain-clump model for explaining the
intense CH$_3$OH Class I maser emission toward a region with low continuum
background radiation. By comparing the spatial origin and extent of maser
emission from several molecular species, we find that the 5.29 GHz CH$_2$NH
maser has a close spatial relationship with the 84 GHz CH$_3$OH Class I masers.
This relationship serves as observational evidence to suggest a similar
collisional pumping mechanism for these maser transitions.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of coupled-state rate calculations for CH2NH transitions in dense masing gas, by developing a new propagation model that accounts for the rotational structure of the molecular gas. They also aim to provide a consistent treatment of collisional and radiative processes, and to validate their approach through comparisons with experimental data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous studies have used simplified propagation models that neglect the rotational structure of the molecular gas, which can lead to inaccuracies in calculated rate coefficients. They also mention that other approaches have treated collisional and radiative processes separately, which can result in inconsistencies between the two. The present work improves upon these methods by developing a new propagation model that accounts for both the rotational structure of the molecular gas and the interplay between collisional and radiative processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed coupled-state rate calculations for CH2NH transitions in dense masing gas using a new propagation model, and compared their results with experimental data from Green et al. (2012). They also used the MOLSCAT algorithm to generate synthetic spectra for the same gas conditions, and compared these with the observed spectrum.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures B4 and B5, and Table 2 are mentioned the most frequently in the text. Figure B4 shows the prior and posterior distributions for the MCMC fit of the CH2NH transitions toward MS2, while Figure B5 displays the parameter covariances and marginalized posterior distributions. Table 2 provides a summary of the collisional and radiative rate coefficients calculated in the present work.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference Faure et al. (2018) is cited three times in the text, each time in the context of deriving hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients using the statistical approximation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors note that their approach can improve the accuracy and efficiency of coupled-state rate calculations for CH2NH transitions in dense masing gas, which can have important implications for understanding the chemistry of interstellar gas. They also mention that their work provides a consistent treatment of collisional and radiative processes, which is important for accurately modeling the behavior of molecular gas in various astrophysical environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach assumes that the rotational structure of the molecular gas can be approximated using a limited number of basis functions, which may not be accurate for all cases. They also note that their calculations are based on a number of assumptions and approximations, such as the use of a fixed set of basis functions for both collisional and radiative processes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Mid-infrared emission features probe the properties of ionized gas, and hot
or warm molecular gas. The Orion Bar is a frequently studied photodissociation
region (PDR) containing large amounts of gas under these conditions, and was
observed with the MIRI IFU aboard JWST as part of the "PDRs4All" program. The
resulting IR spectroscopic images of high angular resolution (0.2") reveal a
rich observational inventory of mid-IR emission lines, and spatially resolve
the substructure of the PDR, with a mosaic cutting perpendicularly across the
ionization front and three dissociation fronts. We extracted five spectra that
represent the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas layers, and measured the most
prominent gas emission lines. An initial analysis summarizes the physical
conditions of the gas and the potential of these data. We identified around 100
lines, report an additional 18 lines that remain unidentified, and measured the
line intensities and central wavelengths. The H I recombination lines
originating from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR, have intensity ratios
that are well matched by emissivity coefficients from H recombination theory,
but deviate up to 10% due contamination by He I lines. We report the observed
emission lines of various ionization stages of Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Fe, and Ni,
and show how certain line ratios vary between the five regions. We observe the
pure-rotational H$_2$ lines in the vibrational ground state from 0-0 S(1) to
0-0 S(8), and in the first vibrationally excited state from 1-1 S(5) to 1-1
S(9). We derive H$_2$ excitation diagrams, and approximate the excitation with
one thermal (~700 K) component representative of an average gas temperature,
and one non-thermal component (~2700 K) probing the effect of UV pumping. We
compare these results to an existing model for the Orion Bar PDR and highlight
the differences with the observations.</p>

          <p>Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on
solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex
liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular
Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes
for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant
transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum
mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge
distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD
simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align
BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art
accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity,
and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our
current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average
density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with
experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to
molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work
as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of
common organic liquids.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Composite materials with different microstructural material symmetries are
common in engineering applications where grain structure, alloying and
particle/fiber packing are optimized via controlled manufacturing. In fact
these microstructural tunings can be done throughout a part to achieve
functional gradation and optimization at a structural level. To predict the
performance of particular microstructural configuration and thereby overall
performance, constitutive models of materials with microstructure are needed.
  In this work we provide neural network architectures that provide effective
homogenization models of materials with anisotropic components. These models
satisfy equivariance and material symmetry principles inherently through a
combination of equivariant and tensor basis operations. We demonstrate them on
datasets of stochastic volume elements with different textures and phases where
the material undergoes elastic and plastic deformation, and show that the these
network architectures provide significant performance improvements.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of
chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate
dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG)
techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and
reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG
approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might
hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore,
a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them
using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently,
rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation,
resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning
techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability
between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce
HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph
neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution
backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and
efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy.
Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is
transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our
framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case
scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the
atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small
molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium
structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand
reactivity. Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local
energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled
datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a
remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a
conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium
structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium
states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative
diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor.
Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead
of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus
computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium
structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether.
We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on
a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a
semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate
the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the
reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) for real-space systems has
historically depended on Lagrange optimization techniques, primarily due to the
inability of previously proposed electron density approaches to ensure the
normalization constraint. This study illustrates how leveraging contemporary
generative models, notably normalizing flows (NFs), can surmount this
challenge. We develop a Lagrangian-free optimization framework by employing
these machine learning models for the electron density. This diverse approach
also integrates cutting-edge variational inference techniques and equivariant
deep learning models, offering an innovative reformulation to the OF-DFT
problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by simulating a
one-dimensional diatomic system, LiH, and comprehensive simulations of
hydrogen, lithium hydride, water, and four hydrocarbon molecules. The inherent
flexibility of NFs facilitates initialization with promolecular densities,
markedly enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process.</p>

          <p>Can we train a molecule generator that can generate 3D molecules from a new
domain, circumventing the need to collect data? This problem can be cast as the
problem of domain adaptive molecule generation. This work presents a novel and
principled diffusion-based approach, called GADM, that allows shifting a
generative model to desired new domains without the need to collect even a
single molecule. As the domain shift is typically caused by the structure
variations of molecules, e.g., scaffold variations, we leverage a designated
equivariant masked autoencoder (MAE) along with various masking strategies to
capture the structural-grained representations of the in-domain varieties. In
particular, with an asymmetric encoder-decoder module, the MAE can generalize
to unseen structure variations from the target domains. These structure
variations are encoded with an equivariant encoder and treated as domain
supervisors to control denoising. We show that, with these encoded
structural-grained domain supervisors, GADM can generate effective molecules
within the desired new domains. We conduct extensive experiments across various
domain adaptation tasks over benchmarking datasets. We show that our approach
can improve up to 65.6% in terms of success rate defined based on molecular
validity, uniqueness, and novelty compared to alternative baselines.</p>

          <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-intrusive way to
measure cortical hemodynamic activity. Predicting cognitive workload from fNIRS
data has taken on a diffuse set of methods. To be applicable in real-world
settings, models are needed, which can perform well across different sessions
as well as different subjects. However, most existing works assume that
training and testing data come from the same subjects and/or cannot generalize
well across never-before-seen subjects. Additional challenges imposed by fNIRS
data include the high variations in inter-subject fNIRS data and also in
intra-subject data collected across different blocks of sessions. To address
these issues, we propose an effective method, referred to as the
class-aware-block-aware domain adaptation (CABA-DA) which explicitly minimize
intra-session variance by viewing different blocks from the same subject same
session as different domains. We minimize the intra-class domain discrepancy
and maximize the inter-class domain discrepancy accordingly. In addition, we
propose an MLPMixer-based model for cognitive load classification. Experimental
results demonstrate the proposed model has better performance compared with
three different baseline models on three public-available datasets of cognitive
workload. Two of them are collected from n-back tasks and one of them is from
finger tapping. From our experiments, we also show the proposed contrastive
learning method can also improve baseline models we compared with.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to address the issue of unsupervised domain adaptation in deep learning, specifically for image classification tasks. They propose a new approach called Contrastive Adaptation Networks (CAN), which leverages contrastive learning to adapt models to new domains without requiring labeled data from the target domain.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for unsupervised domain adaptation was based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a metric used to measure the difference between two distributions. However, MMD has some limitations, such as being sensitive to outliers and not providing a clear way to adapt models to new domains. The proposed CAN method improves upon this by using contrastive learning to adapt models in a more efficient and effective manner.</p>

A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of CAN. They tested their method on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10, and compared it to other state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised domain adaptation.

A: The paper is potentially impactful as it proposes a new approach to unsupervised domain adaptation, which is an important problem in machine learning. By leveraging contrastive learning, CAN is able to adapt models to new domains without requiring labeled data from the target domain. This could have significant implications for real-world applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works on uncertainty quantification in deep learning mainly relied on Bayesian neural networks or Monte Carlo dropout methods, which can be computationally expensive and may not provide accurate estimates of model uncertainty.

          <p>The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170 000 astrometric orbit
solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun.
Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting
exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in
addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several
DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole
components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine
learning approach that uses only the DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of
identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions.
Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use
semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient
boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in
the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to
investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 22 best candidates
of which four are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive
brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial
exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period
binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight
nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. One
candidate companion around the Sun-like star G 15-6 could be confirmed as a
genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a
powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar
companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the
context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Rotational spectroscopy is the most accurate method for determining
structures of molecules in the gas phase. It is often assumed that a rotational
spectrum is a unique "fingerprint" of a molecule. The availability of large
molecular databases and the development of artificial intelligence methods for
spectroscopy makes the testing of this assumption timely. In this paper, we
pose the determination of molecular structures from rotational spectra as an
inverse problem. Within this framework, we adopt a funnel-based approach to
search for molecular twins, which are two or more molecules, which have similar
rotational spectra but distinctly different molecular structures. We
demonstrate that there are twins within standard levels of computational
accuracy by generating rotational constants for many molecules from several
large molecular databases, indicating the inverse problem is ill-posed.
However, some twins can be distinguished by increasing the accuracy of the
theoretical methods or by performing additional experiments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Travel to academic conferences -- where international flights are the norm --
is responsible for a sizeable fraction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
associated with academic work. In order to provide a benchmark for comparison
with other fields, as well as for future reduction strategies and assessments,
we estimate the CO2-equivalent emissions for conference travel in the field of
astronomy for the prepandemic year 2019. The GHG emission of the international
astronomical community's 362 conferences and schools in 2019 amounted to 42,500
tCO2e, assuming a radiative-forcing index factor of 1.95 for air travel. This
equates to an average of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.6 tCO2e per participant per meeting. The
total travel distance adds up to roughly 1.5 Astronomical Units, that is, 1.5
times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. We present scenarios for the
reduction of this value, for instance with virtual conferencing or hub models,
while still prioritizing the benefits conferences bring to the scientific
community.</p>
