          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized
quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological
radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations,
including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable
IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar
IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is
critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic
fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star
formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy
IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches)
in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then
dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales
~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept
up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong
tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape
depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as
the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (< yr) and tidal fields
are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular
momentum or fragment catastrophically at <10 au scales requires novel PSD
simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with
planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs,
though we discuss a couple of viable models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies and to understand how these properties vary with galaxy properties, including mass, size, and environment. They also seek to determine whether there are any correlations between the molecular gas properties and other galaxy properties, such as the amount of stellar mass or the presence of a central bar.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies was limited by the availability of high-quality observational data and the lack of a comprehensive framework for analyzing these data. This paper improves upon previous studies by using a large, homogeneous dataset of CO(2-1) observations from the HERA and ASTE telescopes, combined with a novel analysis method that accounts for the effects of beam smearing and the presence of multiple velocity components in the molecular gas.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed a large-scale survey of nearby star-forming galaxies using a uniform observational protocol to measure the CO(2-1) emission line. They also developed a novel analysis method that accounts for the effects of beam smearing and the presence of multiple velocity components in the molecular gas.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a overview of the sample selection, the molecular gas properties, and the correlation between molecular gas and galaxy properties, respectively. Table 2 is also important as it presents the summary of the molecular gas properties for the entire sample.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Tremaine 2001) is cited several times in the paper, particularly when discussing the previous state of the art in studying molecular gas properties. The authors also cite (Wada et al. 1994, 2009) and (Banerjee et al. 2011) to support their claims about the molecular gas properties and the correlation between molecular gas and galaxy properties, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful as it provides a comprehensive analysis of the molecular gas properties in nearby star-forming galaxies, which is essential for understanding the role of molecular gas in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The novel analysis method developed in this paper can also be applied to other observational datasets, providing a new way of studying molecular gas properties in galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a limited sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, which may not be representative of all galaxies. Additionally, the analysis method developed in this paper assumes that the molecular gas is in local thermal equilibrium, which may not always be the case.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to the Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for detecting and characterizing interstellar dust grains in the Milky Way's inner galaxy using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). They seek to improve upon current methods, which are limited by their reliance on model-based techniques and low signal-to-noise ratios.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting interstellar dust grains involved using radio astronomy observations to constrain the size distribution of dust grains. However, these methods were limited by their reliance on model-based techniques and low signal-to-noise ratios. This paper improves upon these methods by using ALMA observations to directly detect and characterize dust grains, without relying on models or assumptions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used ALMA observations of the 1.3 mm emission line of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the inner galaxy to detect and characterize interstellar dust grains. They applied a novel analysis method, which combines wavelet analysis and machine learning techniques, to identify and classify dust grains based on their spectral energy distribution (SED).</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, 3, and Tables 1-3 were referenced most frequently in the text. Figure 1 presents the observed SEDs of dust grains in the inner galaxy, while Figure 2 shows the resulting dust maps after applying the novel analysis method. Table 1 lists the properties of the observed dust grains, while Table 2 compares the results of this paper with previous studies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: Reference [87] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed analysis of the NaCl emission line and its use in dust studies. The citation is given in the context of explaining the observed SEDs of dust grains in the inner galaxy.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of interstellar dust grains and their distribution in the Milky Way's inner galaxy. By directly detecting and characterizing dust grains using ALMA observations, this study provides a more accurate and detailed picture of the dust population than previous methods. This could have important implications for understanding the physics of dust grain formation and evolution, as well as the effects of dust on the galaxy's overall structure and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of this paper is that it relies on a relatively small sample size of observations, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the novel analysis method used in this study may not be applicable to other astronomical sources or observational datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>FIR and submm observations have established the fundamental role of
dust-obscured star formation in the assembly of stellar mass over the past 12
billion years. At z between 2 and 4, the bulk of star formation is enshrouded
in dust, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) contain about half of the
total stellar mass density. Star formation develops in dense molecular clouds,
and is regulated by a complex interplay between all the ISM components that
contribute to the energy budget of a galaxy: gas, dust, cosmic rays,
interstellar electromagnetic fields, gravitational field, dark matter.
Molecular gas is the actual link between star forming gas and its complex
environment, providing by far the richest amount of information about the star
formation process. However, molecular lines interpretation requires complex
modeling of astrochemical networks, which regulate the molecular formation and
establishes molecular abundances in a cloud, and a modeling of the physical
conditions of the gas in which molecular energy levels become populated. This
paper critically reviews the main astrochemical parameters needed to get
predictions about molecular signals in DSFGs. We review the current knowledge
and the open questions about the interstellar medium of DSFGs, outlying the key
role of molecular gas as a tracer and shaper of the star formation process.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the main problems in astrochemistry is determining the amount of
sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the interstellar medium. The detection
of the main sulfur reservoirs (icy H$_2$S and atomic gas) has been challenging,
and estimates are based on the reliability of models to account for the
abundances of species containing less than 1% of the total sulfur. The high
sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope provides an unprecedented
opportunity to estimate the sulfur abundance through the observation of the [S
I] 25.249 $\mu$m line. We used the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m, and
[S l] 25.249 $\mu$m lines to estimate the amount of sulfur in the ionized and
molecular gas along the Orion Bar. For the theoretical part, we used an
upgraded version of the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code to model the
observations. New inelastic collision rates of neutral atomic sulfur with
ortho- and para- molecular hydrogen were calculated to predict the line
intensities. The [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m and [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m lines are detected
over the imaged region with a shallow increase (by a factor of 4) toward the
HII region. We estimate a moderate sulfur depletion, by a factor of $\sim$2, in
the ionized gas. The corrugated interface between the molecular and atomic
phases gives rise to several edge-on dissociation fronts we refer to as DF1,
DF2, and DF3. The [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only detected toward DF2 and DF3,
the dissociation fronts located farthest from the HII region. The detailed
modeling of DF3 using the Meudon PDR code shows that the emission of the [S l]
25.249 $\mu$m line is coming from warm ($>$ 40 K) molecular gas located at
A$_{\rm V}$ $\sim$ 1$-$5 mag from the ionization front. Moreover, the intensity
of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only accounted for if we assume the presence
of undepleted sulfur.</p>

However, these methods are limited by their inability to account for the effects of dust on the observed light. The current study proposes a new algorithm that takes into account the thermal emission and scattering properties of dust, improving upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate detection and characterization of exoplanets.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced frequently throughout the paper. Figure 1 shows the wavelength dependence of the dust scattering cross section, while Table 1 lists the parameters used in the simulations. Figure 2 demonstrates the impact of dust on the transit signal, and Table 2 compares the results of the new algorithm with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of dust on exoplanet detection and characterization. The authors also cite [2-4] to support their claims about the limitations of current methods and the potential of the new algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our ability to detect and characterize exoplanets, particularly those in the habitable zone around G-type stars. By taking into account the effects of dust on the observed light, the new algorithm could provide more accurate estimates of exoplanet masses, sizes, and compositions, which are crucial for understanding the potential for life.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach assumes a uniform dust composition and geometry, which may not be realistic in all cases. Additionally, they note that further improvements to the algorithm could involve incorporating more sophisticated models of dust properties and observing conditions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently
been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The
photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated
multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are
done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the
three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network
method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full
dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The
wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the
number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious
states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a
projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in
astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a
lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the
recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in
understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be
captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been
developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms
driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is
still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction
networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal
transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and
products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median
structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier
height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD
and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25% through pretraining
React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory,
GFN2-xTB. We envision the great accuracy and fast inference of React-OT useful
in targeting TSs when exploring chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the first systematic investigation of supervised scaling laws
outside of an ImageNet-like context - on images of galaxies. We use 840k galaxy
images and over 100M annotations by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, comparable in scale
to Imagenet-1K. We find that adding annotated galaxy images provides a power
law improvement in performance across all architectures and all tasks, while
adding trainable parameters is effective only for some (typically more
subjectively challenging) tasks. We then compare the downstream performance of
finetuned models pretrained on either ImageNet-12k alone vs. additionally
pretrained on our galaxy images. We achieve an average relative error rate
reduction of 31% across 5 downstream tasks of scientific interest. Our
finetuned models are more label-efficient and, unlike their
ImageNet-12k-pretrained equivalents, often achieve linear transfer performance
equal to that of end-to-end finetuning. We find relatively modest additional
downstream benefits from scaling model size, implying that scaling alone is not
sufficient to address our domain gap, and suggest that practitioners with
qualitatively different images might benefit more from in-domain adaption
followed by targeted downstream labelling.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and
properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic
nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their
dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic
microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals
(NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting
of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully
disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent
fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the
colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of
densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due
to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase,
which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with
simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains
the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via
XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to
elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and
other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and
non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for understanding coarsening rates in superlattices was limited to modeling the effect of temperature and composition, but not the driving force.

          <p>Optical Bound States in the Continuum are peculiar localized states within
the continuous spectrum that are unaffected by any far-field radiation and
intrinsic absorption, therefore possessing infinite mode lifetime and Q-factor.
To date they have been widely studied in dielectric structures whereas their
exploitation in lossy media, i.e. plasmonic nanostructures, still remains a
challenge. Here, we show the emergence of a hybrid BIC state in a 2D system of
silver-filled dimers, quasi-embedded in a high-index dielectric waveguide. The
hybrid BIC onset is found to be highly dependent on the bare modes' spectral
and spatial overlap, but particularly on the plasmonic field's intensity. By
tailoring the hybridizing plasmonic/photonic fractions we select an ideal
coupling regime for which the mode exhibits both, high Q-factor values and
strong near-field enhancement tightly confined in the nanogap and a
consequently extremely small modal volume. We demonstrate that this optical
layout can be exploited in a proof-of-concept experiment for the detection of
TAR DNA-binding protein 43, which outperforms the sensitivity of current
label-free biosensing platforms, reaching the zeptomolar range of
concentration.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact
on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting
the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a
promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure
prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and
first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of
deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize
pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present
AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant
inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures.
AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal
material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By
leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal
structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability
in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights
the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design
of new materials with tailored properties.</p>

allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds
due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C +

          <p>Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain
both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups,
which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the
universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is
known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all
surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the
star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter
wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of
NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify
NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments
have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible
precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the
Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the
rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core
G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density
of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$
with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the
rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to
H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived
abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up
chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible
formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and
we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase
reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to detect and characterize possible precursors of glycine, a crucial amino acid in the interstellar medium (ISM), using observations of molecular lines. They specifically target methanimine (CH2NH) and hydrogenation of solid hydrogen cyanide HCN at low temperatures, which are potential precursors of glycine.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in detecting and characterizing possible precursors of glycine involved observations of molecular lines in the Orion Nebula, but the results were limited due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and the absence of high-quality spectra. This paper improves upon these observations by using a new instrument, CASSIS, which provides higher spectral resolution and improved S/N ratios, allowing for more accurate detection and characterization of molecular lines.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used the CASSIS instrument to observe molecular lines in the Sagittarius B2(M) star-forming region at 350 GHz, which is a suitable frequency range for detecting methanimine (CH2NH) and hydrogenation of solid hydrogen cyanide HCN. They also performed simulations to evaluate the potential impact of different parameters on the observed spectra.</p>

A: The reference [1] by Suzuki et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular line survey of Sagittarius B2(M) and its comparison with Sagittarius B2(N). The references [2], [3], and [6] are also cited frequently to provide additional context and support for the authors' claims.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful as it provides new insights into the formation of glycine, a crucial amino acid in the ISM, by detecting and characterizing possible precursors such as methanimine (CH2NH) and hydrogenation of solid hydrogen cyanide HCN. The improved spectral resolution and S/N ratios provided by the CASSIS instrument enable more accurate detection and characterization of molecular lines, which can help to advance our understanding of the chemical evolution of star-forming regions.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the authors only observed a single star-forming region (Sagittarius B2(M)), which may limit the generalizability of their findings to other regions.

          <p>Understanding the large-scale three-dimensional structure of the inner
heliosphere, while important in its own right, is crucial for space weather
applications, such as forecasting the time of arrival and propagation of
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This study uses sunRunner3D (3D), a 3-D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, to simulate solar wind (SW) streams and
generate background states. SR3D employs the boundary conditions generated by
CORona-HELiosphere (CORHEL) and the PLUTO code to compute the plasma properties
of the SW with the MHD approximation up to 1.1 AU in the inner heliosphere. We
demonstrate that SR3D reproduces global features of Corotating Interaction
Regions (CIRs) observed by Earth-based spacecraft (OMNI) and the Solar
TErrestial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A for a set of Carrington rotations
(CRs) that cover a period that lays in the late declining phase of solar cycle
24. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model solutions are valid in the
corotating and inertial frames of references. Moreover, a comparison between
SR3D simulations and in-situ measurements shows reasonable agreement with the
observations, and our results are comparable to those achieved by Predictive
Science Inc.'s Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code. We
have also undertaken a comparative analysis with the Space Weather Adaptive
Simulation Framework for Solar Wind (SWASTi-SW), a PLUTO physics-based model,
to evaluate the precision of various initial boundary conditions. Finally, we

          <p>Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main
sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed. These discoveries
have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems,
revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common
in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar
system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now
moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits)
towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With
improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology
of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in
our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the
geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major
challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we
may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In
the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky
planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the
implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal
atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term
geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including
whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle
can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping
through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the
current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and
evolution.</p>

          <p>Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked
and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal
strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for
variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral
content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as
resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year
period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible
with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is
frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on
an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the
Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar
cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which
is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed
spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has
been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible
to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single
frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year
period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely
with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate
variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal
spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method
to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate
records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar
cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and
assessing the Sun climate connection.</p>
