          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized
quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological
radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations,
including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable
IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar
IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is
critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic
fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star
formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy
IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches)
in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then
dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales
~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept
up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong
tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape
depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as
the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (< yr) and tidal fields
are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular
momentum or fragment catastrophically at <10 au scales requires novel PSD
simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with
planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs,
though we discuss a couple of viable models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to identify the most promising molecular gas tracers for use in forthcoming generations of galaxy formation simulations by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the literature.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in galaxy formation simulations involved the use of a limited number of gas tracers, which were often not well-suited for studying the complex interplay between gas and dark matter. This paper improves upon that by identifying a larger set of gas tracers and developing a more nuanced understanding of their properties and behaviors.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of the literature to identify the most promising molecular gas tracers for use in forthcoming generations of galaxy formation simulations. They also developed a set of criteria to evaluate the suitability of each tracer for different simulation applications.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the different gas tracers considered in the study, while Table 1 lists the criteria used to evaluate their suitability for different simulation applications.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Wada et al., 2009] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the different gas tracers used in galaxy formation simulations. The authors also cite [Tsukamoto et al., 2017] to support their evaluation of the suitability of each tracer for different simulation applications.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by providing a comprehensive analysis of the most promising molecular gas tracers for use in forthcoming generations of simulations. By identifying the strengths and limitations of each tracer, this study can help guide the development of future simulation techniques and improve the accuracy of our predictions about galaxy formation and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on a limited set of tracers, which may not capture the full complexity of gas dynamics in galaxies. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their evaluation of the suitability of each tracer for different simulation applications may be subjective and could benefit from further validation through additional simulations or observations.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
