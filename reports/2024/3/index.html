          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic
systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and
catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires
compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for
training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising
non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage
training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt
a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the
noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to
equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much
larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a
non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has
non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions
compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium
structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely
defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original
non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are
denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the
forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying
the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires
encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate
forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the
effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17
datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on
OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an equivariant neural network for predicting vibrational and
phonon modes of molecules and periodic crystals, respectively. These
predictions are made by evaluating the second derivative Hessian matrices of
the learned energy model that is trained with the energy and force data. Using
this method, we are able to efficiently predict phonon dispersion and the
density of states for inorganic crystal materials. For molecules, we also
derive the symmetry constraints for IR/Raman active modes by analyzing the
phonon mode irreducible representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that
using Hessian as a new type of higher-order training data improves energy
models beyond models that only use lower-order energy and force data. With this
second derivative approach, one can directly relate the energy models to the
experimental observations for the vibrational properties. This approach further
connects to a broader class of physical observables with a generalized energy
model that includes external fields.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling molecular interactions with high accuracy and efficiency, particularly in the presence of external fields such as electric fields. The authors aim to improve upon the previous state of the art in this area by developing a novel neural network architecture that can capture the dependences of the total energy on higher-order derivatives of the atomic coordinates and the electric field.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in molecular modeling involved using neural networks to represent the total energy as a sum of pairwise interactions between atoms, but these models were limited in their ability to capture dependences on higher-order derivatives. The paper improves upon this by incorporating the electric field dependence into the energy model, allowing for more accurate predictions of molecular properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their novel neural network architecture in modeling molecular interactions with external fields. These include training the model on a dataset of molecular structures with varying torsion angles, and evaluating its ability to predict the force and energy of the system under different external field configurations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the proposed architecture and its performance on various molecular systems. Figure 4 is particularly important, as it shows the force MAE map for slightly perturbed structures around the torsion angle, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Hessian training method in suppressing force errors.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a
promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption
and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse
space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks.
This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical
properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico
high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an
accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs.
Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally
reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite
compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference
electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random
structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given
only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and
reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D
perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio
methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive
with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the
structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding
perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the
accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables
efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and
inorganic layers.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy
materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces
and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional
use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of
machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic
structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting
and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst
Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain
high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the
local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly
improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art
accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general
machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct
inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on
complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge
learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the
highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated
computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the
high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.</p>

been shown to markedly change its reactivity by significantly modifying the

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The formation of stars, particularly the high-mass star formation, poses
several still open questions. Nowadays, thanks to the most modern telescopes
and instruments, we are able to observe and analyse many physical and chemical
processes involved in the birth of massive stars. This work introduces to the
interstellar medium, cradle of the stars, and makes focus on the interstellar
structures distributed in the different spatial scales related to the collapse
of the gas that gives rise to the star formation processes. Through some
current works done by the investigation group of Interstellar Medium, Star
Formation and Astrochemistry belonging to Instituto de Astronom\'ia y F\'isica
del Espacio (https://interestelariafe.wixsite.com/mediointerestelar), it is
shown that the observational study of the star formation is a research that
must be carried out in a multispectral way, pointing to the spatial multiscale.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The addition of individual quanta of rotational excitation to a molecule has
been shown to markedly change its reactivity by significantly modifying the
intermolecular interactions. So far, it has only been possible to observe these
rotational effects in a very limited number of systems due to lack of
rotational selectivity in chemical reaction experiments. The recent development
of rotationally controlled molecular beams now makes such investigations
possible for a wide range of systems. This is particularly crucial in order to
understand the chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium, such as
exploring the formation of carbon-based astrochemical molecules and the
emergence of molecular complexity in interstellar space from the reaction of
small atomic and molecular fragments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this study, we use THz-assisted atom probe tomography (APT) to analyse
silica matrices used to encapsulate biomolecules. This technique provides the
chemical composition and 3D structure without significantly heating the
biosample, which is crucial for studying soft organic molecules such as
proteins. Our results show that THz pulses and a positive static field trigger
controlled evaporation of silica matrices, enabling 4D imaging with chemical
sensitivity comparable to UV laser-assisted APT. To support the interpretation
of these experimental results, we devise a computational model based on
time-dependent density functional theory to describe the interaction between
silica matrices and THz radiation. This model captures the nonlinear dynamics
driven by THz-pulses and the interplay between the THz source and the static
electric field in real time. This interdisciplinary approach expands the
capabilities of APT and holds promise for other THz-based analyses offering new
insights into material dynamics in complex biological environments.</p>

          <p>Understanding the pivotal role of oxygen-containing organic compounds in

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Burning fossil fuels emits a significant amount of CO2, causing climate
change concerns. CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to reduce emissions, with
fullerenes showing promise as CO2 adsorbents. Recent research focuses on
modifying fullerenes using an electric field. In light of this, we carried out
DFT studies on some B, N, and P doped C20 (C20-nXn (n = 0, 1, 2, and 3; X = B,
N, and P)) in the absence and presence of an electric field in the range of
0-0.02 a.u.. The cohesive energy was calculated to ensure their thermodynamic
stability showing, that despite having lesser cohesive energies than C20, they
appear in a favorable range. Moreover, the charge distribution for all
structures was depicted using the ESP map. Most importantly, we evaluated the
adsorption energy, height, and CO2 angle, demonstrating the B and N-doped
fullerenes had the stronger interaction with CO2, which by far exceeded C20's,
improving its physisorption to physicochemical adsorption. Although the
adsorption energy of P-doped fullerenes was not as satisfactory, in most cases,
increasing the electric field led to enhancing CO2 adsorption and incorporating
chemical attributes to CO2-fullerene interaction. The HOMO--LUMO plots were
obtained by which we discovered that unlike the P-doped C20, the surprising
activity of B and N-doped C20s against CO2 originates from a high concentration
of the HOMO-LUMO orbitals on B and N atoms. Additionally, the charge
distribution for all structures was depicted using the ESP map. In the present
article, we attempt to introduce more effective fullerene-based materials for
CO2 capture as well as strategies to enhance their efficiency and revealing
adsorption nature over B, N, and P-doped fullerenes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Simulations of chemical reaction probabilities in gas surface dynamics
require the calculation of ensemble averages over many tens of thousands of
reaction events to predict dynamical observables that can be compared to
experiments. At the same time, the energy landscapes need to be accurately
mapped, as small errors in barriers can lead to large deviations in reaction
probabilities. This brings a particularly interesting challenge for machine
learning interatomic potentials, which are becoming well-established tools to
accelerate molecular dynamics simulations. We compare state-of-the-art machine
learning interatomic potentials with a particular focus on their inference
performance on CPUs and suitability for high throughput simulation of reactive
chemistry at surfaces. The considered models include polarizable atom
interaction neural networks (PaiNN), recursively embedded atom neural networks
(REANN), the MACE equivariant graph neural network, and atomic cluster
expansion potentials (ACE). The models are applied to a dataset on reactive
molecular hydrogen scattering on low-index surface facets of copper. All models
are assessed for their accuracy, time-to-solution, and ability to simulate
reactive sticking probabilities as a function of the rovibrational initial
state and kinetic incidence energy of the molecule. REANN and MACE models
provide the best balance between accuracy and time-to-solution and can be
considered the current state-of-the-art in gas-surface dynamics. PaiNN models
require many features for the best accuracy, which causes significant losses in
computational efficiency. ACE models provide the fastest time-to-solution,
however, models trained on the existing dataset were not able to achieve
sufficiently accurate predictions in all cases.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Among the chloride-based Li-ion solid electrolytes, Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) have
emerged as potential candidates due to their affordability, moisture stability,
and high ionic conductivity. LZC synthesized by solid-state heating exhibits
limited Li-ion conductivity while the mechanochemical ball-milled material is
more conductive. In this computational study, we integrate thermodynamic
modeling, using cluster-expansion Monte Carlo, and kinetic modeling, using
molecular dynamics, to investigate whether cation disorder can be achieved in
LZC, and how it affects Li-ion transport. Our results indicate that fast Li-ion
conductivity is induced by the activation of Li/vacancy disorder, which itself
depends on the degree of Zr disorder. We find that the very high-temperature
scale at which equilibrium Zr-disorder can form precludes any equilibrium
synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why
only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling leads to good
conductivity. We identify as the critical mechanism the lack of Li/vacancy
disorder near room temperature when Zr is well-ordered. Our simulations further
show that the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature is lowered by Zr
disorder, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room
temperature. The insights obtained from this study raise a challenge for the
large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term
stability of their properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding
applications in many areas from energy storage to solvents, where they have
been touted as ``designer solvents'' as they can be mixed to precisely tailor
the physiochemical properties. As using machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs) to simulate ILs is still relatively unexplored, several questions need
to be answered to see if MLIPs can be transformative for ILs. Since ILs are
often not pure, but are either mixed together or contain additives, we first
demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be compositionally transferable,
i.e., the MLIP can be applied to mixtures of ions not directly trained on,
whilst only being trained on a few mixtures of the same ions. We also
investigate the accuracy of MLIPs for a novel IL, which we experimentally
synthesize and characterize. Our MLIP trained on $\sim$200 DFT frames is in
reasonable agreement with our experiments and DFT.</p>

          <p>We use both chirped-pulse Fourier transform and frequency modulated
absorption spectroscopy to study the rotational spectrum of 2-methoxyethanol in
several frequency regions ranging from 8.7-500 GHz. The resulting rotational
parameters permitted a search for this molecule in Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward the massive
protocluster NGC 6334I as well as source B of the low-mass protostellar system
IRAS 16293-2422. 25 rotational transitions are observed in the ALMA Band 4 data
toward NGC 6334I, resulting in the first interstellar detection of
2-methoxyethanol. A column density of $1.3_{-0.9}^{+1.4} \times 10^{17}$
cm$^{-2}$ is derived at an excitation temperature of $143_{-39}^{+31}$ K.
However, molecular signal is not observed in the Band 7 data toward IRAS
16293-2422B and an upper limit column density of $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$
is determined. Various possible formation pathways--including radical
recombination and insertion reactions--are discussed. We also investigate
physical differences between the two interstellar sources that could result in
the observed abundance variations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields
that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural
networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy
of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive
than established molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Here, we propose
Grappa, a machine learning framework to predict MM parameters from the
molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer
with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting Grappa force field
outperformstabulated and machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy
at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular
Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces
of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to
uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy.
We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations
from a small fast folding protein up to a whole virus particle. Our force field
sets the stage for biomolecular simulations closer to chemical accuracy, but
with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model
the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of
quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This
research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their
proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key
issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies
and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of
molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective
variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the
free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane
and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half
based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed
energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to
replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES
of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data
coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV
distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential
energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models
trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab
initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy
predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an
all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the
importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study
points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the
need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for
effective model training.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The interaction of condensed phase systems with external electric fields is
crucial in myriad processes in nature and technology ranging from the
field-directed motion of cells (galvanotaxis), to energy storage and conversion
systems including supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells. Molecular
simulation in the presence of electric fields would give important atomistic
insight into these processes but applications of the most accurate methods such
as ab-initio molecular dynamics are limited in scope by their computational
expense. Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular
Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back the accessible time and length scales of such
simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on the atoms are
expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a
standard neural network potential and a field-induced perturbation obtained
from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The
latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained
on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the
dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant and the field-dependent
IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or
experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V/A. This is
remarkable because, in contrast to most previous approaches, the two neural
networks on which PNNL MD is based are exclusively trained on zero-field
molecular configurations demonstrating that the networks not only interpolate
but also reliably extrapolate the field response. PNNP MD is based on rigorous
theory yet it is simple, general, modular, and systematically improvable
allowing us to obtain atomistic insight into the interaction of a wide range of
condensed phase systems with external electric fields.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advanced generative model (e.g., diffusion model) derived from simplified
continuity assumptions of data distribution, though showing promising progress,
has been difficult to apply directly to geometry generation applications due to
the multi-modality and noise-sensitive nature of molecule geometry. This work
introduces Geometric Bayesian Flow Networks (GeoBFN), which naturally fits
molecule geometry by modeling diverse modalities in the differentiable
parameter space of distributions. GeoBFN maintains the SE-(3) invariant density
modeling property by incorporating equivariant inter-dependency modeling on
parameters of distributions and unifying the probabilistic modeling of
different modalities. Through optimized training and sampling techniques, we
demonstrate that GeoBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D
molecule generation benchmarks in terms of generation quality (90.87% molecule
stability in QM9 and 85.6% atom stability in GEOM-DRUG. GeoBFN can also conduct
sampling with any number of steps to reach an optimal trade-off between
efficiency and quality (e.g., 20-times speedup without sacrificing
performance).</p>

          <p>This work proposes a deep learning (DL)-based framework, namely Sim2Real, for
spectral signal reconstruction in reconstructive spectroscopy, focusing on
efficient data sampling and fast inference time. The work focuses on the
challenge of reconstructing real-world spectral signals under the extreme
setting where only device-informed simulated data are available for training.
Such device-informed simulated data are much easier to collect than real-world
data but exhibit large distribution shifts from their real-world counterparts.
To leverage such simulated data effectively, a hierarchical data augmentation
strategy is introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of this domain shift,
and a corresponding neural network for the spectral signal reconstruction with
our augmented data is designed. Experiments using a real dataset measured from

          <p>Polymer particle size constitutes a crucial characteristic of product quality

analytical technology for in-line concentration monitoring. Recent approaches
and some theoretical considerations show a correlation between Raman signals
and particle sizes but do not determine polymer size from Raman spectroscopic

data set of Raman spectra with associated size measured via dynamic light
scattering of 47 microgel (cross-linked polymer) samples in a diameter range of

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Prostate cancer is a disease which poses an interesting clinical question:
should it be treated? A small subset of prostate cancers are aggressive and
require removal and treatment to prevent metastatic spread. However,
conventional diagnostics remain challenged to risk-stratify such patients,
hence, new methods of approach to biomolecularly subclassify the disease are
needed. Here we use an unsupervised, self-organising map approach to analyse
live-cell Raman spectroscopy data obtained from prostate cell-lines; our aim is
to test the feasibility of this method to differentiate, at the
single-cell-level, cancer from normal using high-dimensional datasets with
minimal preprocessing. The results demonstrate not only successful separation
of normal prostate and cancer cells, but also a new subclustering of the
prostate cancer cell-line into two groups. Initial analysis of the spectra from
each of the cancer subclusters demonstrates a differential expression of
lipids, which, against the normal control, may be linked to disease-related
changes in cellular signalling.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Raman spectroscopy is widely used across scientific domains to characterize
the chemical composition of samples in a non-destructive, label-free manner.
Many applications entail the unmixing of signals from mixtures of molecular
species to identify the individual components present and their proportions,
yet conventional methods for chemometrics often struggle with complex mixture
scenarios encountered in practice. Here, we develop hyperspectral unmixing
algorithms based on autoencoder neural networks, and we systematically validate
them using both synthetic and experimental benchmark datasets created in-house.
Our results demonstrate that unmixing autoencoders provide improved accuracy,
robustness and efficiency compared to standard unmixing methods. We also
showcase the applicability of autoencoders to complex biological settings by
showing improved biochemical characterization of volumetric Raman imaging data
from a monocytic cell.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a novel approach for unmixing Raman spectroscopy data of complex biological samples, specifically sugar solutions, by utilizing an alternative endmember similarity metric called Partial Correlation Coefficient (PCC) instead of the traditional Pearson correlation coefficient. They seek to improve upon the previous state-of-the-art methods that rely on the Pearson correlation coefficient for endmember selection and unmixing.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art methods for unmixing Raman spectroscopy data of complex biological samples rely on the Pearson correlation coefficient for endmember selection and unmixing. These methods are limited by their inability to handle non-linear relationships between endmembers and samples, leading to reduced accuracy in endmember identification and mixing estimation. The proposed approach using PCC as an alternative endmember similarity metric improves upon these methods by accounting for non-linear relationships and providing more accurate endmember estimates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted simulations on synthetic sugar solutions with different concentrations of pure sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) to evaluate the performance of their proposed approach. They also applied the method to real Raman spectroscopy data of sugar solutions with varying concentrations of pure sugars.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures S1-S5 and Tables 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure S1 provides a qualitative comparison of derived endmembers on high and low SNR sugar data, while Table S4 presents the full unmixing results on Raman spectroscopy data from sugar solutions using PCC as an alternative endmember similarity metric.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] by H. Li et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, particularly in the context of the previous state-of-the-art methods that rely on Pearson correlation coefficient for endmember selection and unmixing.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of Raman spectroscopy data unmixing in complex biological samples, such as those with non-linear relationships between endmembers and samples. This could lead to enhanced analysis and interpretation of these samples in various fields, including biomedical research and pharmaceutical development.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed approach may be limited by the choice of PCC as an alternative endmember similarity metric, which may not always capture the non-linear relationships between endmembers and samples. They also suggest that future work could involve the development of more sophisticated endmember selection methods that can handle non-linear relationships.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a self-consistent representation of the atmosphere and implement
the interactions of light with the atmosphere using a photon Monte Carlo
approach. We compile global climate distributions based on historical data,
self-consistent vertical profiles of thermodynamic quantities, spatial models
of cloud variation and cover, and global distributions of four kinds of
aerosols. We then implement refraction, Rayleigh scattering, molecular
interactions, Tyndall-Mie scattering to all photons emitted from astronomical
sources and various background components using physics first principles. This
results in emergent image properties that include: differential astrometry and
elliptical point spread functions predicted completely to the horizon,
arcminute-scale spatial-dependent photometry variations at 20 mmag for short
exposures, excess background spatial variations at 0.2% due the atmosphere, and
a point spread function wing due to water droplets. We reproduce the well-known
correlations in image characteristics: correlations in altitude with absolute
photometry (overall transmission) and relative photometry (spectrally-dependent
transmission), anti-correlations of altitude with differential astrometry
(non-ideal astrometric patterns) and background levels, and an anti-correlation
in absolute photometry with cloud depth. However, we also find further subtle
correlations including an anti-correlation of temperature with background and
differential astrometry, a correlation of temperature with absolute and
relative photometry, an anti-correlation of absolute photometry with humidity,
a correlation of humidity with Lunar background, a significant correlation of
PSF wing with cloud depth, an anti-correlation of background with cloud depth,
and a correlation of lunar background with cloud depth.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A major focus of the planetary science and astrobiology community is the
understanding of planetary habitability, including the myriad factors that
control the evolution and sustainability of temperate surface environments such
as that of Earth. The few substantial terrestrial planetary atmospheres within
the Solar System serve as a critical resource in studying these habitability
factors, from which models can be constructed for application to extrasolar
planets. The recent Astronomy and Astrophysics and Planetary Science and
Astrobiology Decadal Surveys both emphasise the need for an improved
understanding of planetary habitability as an essential goal within the context
of astrobiology. The divergence in climate evolution of Venus and Earth
provides a major, accessible basis for understanding how the habitability of
large rocky worlds evolves with time and what conditions limit the boundaries
of habitability. Here, we argue that Venus can be considered an "anchor point"
for understanding planetary habitability within the context of terrestrial
planet evolution. We discuss the major factors that have influenced the
respective evolutionary pathways of Venus and Earth, how these factors might be
weighted in their overall influence, and the measurements that will shed
further light on their impacts of these worlds' histories. We further discuss
the importance of Venus with respect to both of the recent decadal surveys, and
how these community consensus reports can help shape the exploration of Venus
in the coming decades.</p>
