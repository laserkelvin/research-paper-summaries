          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic
systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and
catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires
compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for
training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising
non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage
training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt
a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the
noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to
equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much
larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a
non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has
non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions
compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium
structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely
defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original
non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are
denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the
forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying
the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires
encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate
forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the
effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17
datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on
OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an equivariant neural network for predicting vibrational and
phonon modes of molecules and periodic crystals, respectively. These
predictions are made by evaluating the second derivative Hessian matrices of
the learned energy model that is trained with the energy and force data. Using
this method, we are able to efficiently predict phonon dispersion and the
density of states for inorganic crystal materials. For molecules, we also
derive the symmetry constraints for IR/Raman active modes by analyzing the
phonon mode irreducible representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that
using Hessian as a new type of higher-order training data improves energy
models beyond models that only use lower-order energy and force data. With this
second derivative approach, one can directly relate the energy models to the
experimental observations for the vibrational properties. This approach further
connects to a broader class of physical observables with a generalized energy
model that includes external fields.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling molecular interactions with high accuracy and efficiency, particularly in the presence of external fields such as electric fields. The authors aim to improve upon the previous state of the art in this area by developing a novel neural network architecture that can capture the dependences of the total energy on higher-order derivatives of the atomic coordinates and the electric field.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in molecular modeling involved using neural networks to represent the total energy as a sum of pairwise interactions between atoms, but these models were limited in their ability to capture dependences on higher-order derivatives. The paper improves upon this by incorporating the electric field dependence into the energy model, allowing for more accurate predictions of molecular properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their novel neural network architecture in modeling molecular interactions with external fields. These include training the model on a dataset of molecular structures with varying torsion angles, and evaluating its ability to predict the force and energy of the system under different external field configurations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the proposed architecture and its performance on various molecular systems. Figure 4 is particularly important, as it shows the force MAE map for slightly perturbed structures around the torsion angle, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Hessian training method in suppressing force errors.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is the work by Behler and Parrinello (2007) [1], which introduced the neural network model for molecular simulations. The authors also cite other relevant works on molecular modeling and machine learning, such as the use of Gaussian processes for molecular simulations (Ensaf et al., 2010) [2] and the development of machine learning models for predicting molecular properties (Car et al., 2018) [3].</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful in the field of molecular simulations, as it proposes a novel neural network architecture that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of molecular modeling. By incorporating the electric field dependence into the energy model, the proposed method can capture more complex molecular interactions and better predict molecular properties under external field conditions.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the development of the novel neural network architecture, without providing a thorough evaluation of its performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of their proposed method.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a
promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption
and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse
space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks.
This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical
properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico
high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an
accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs.
Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally
reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite
compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference
electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random
structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given
only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and
reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D
perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio
methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive
with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the
structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding
perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the
accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables
efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and
inorganic layers.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy
materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces
and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional
use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of
machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic
structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting
and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst
Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain
high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the
local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly
improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art
accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general
machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct
inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on
complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge
learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the
highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated
computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the
high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.</p>
