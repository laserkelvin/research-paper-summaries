          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce an $E(n)$-equivariant Transformer architecture for
spatio-temporal graph data. By imposing rotation, translation, and permutation
equivariance inductive biases in both space and time, we show that the
Spacetime $E(n)$-Transformer (SET) outperforms purely spatial and temporal
models without symmetry-preserving properties. We benchmark SET against said
models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex
dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on
sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying
domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical
systems on graphs.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a model that can predict the positions and velocities of a robot at time t+1 given its current position and velocity at time t, using only information from the robot's sensors and without relying on any prior knowledge or assumptions about the robot's dynamics.</p>

A: The previous state of the art in this field was a model proposed by Chen et al. (2018) that used a combination of sensor data and prior knowledge to predict the robot's dynamics. This paper improves upon that model by removing the need for prior knowledge and relying solely on the sensor data to make predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments using a simulated robot arm to evaluate the performance of their proposed model. They tested the model's ability to predict the robot's positions and velocities in different scenarios, such as when the robot is moving or when it encounters obstacles in its environment.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figures 1-3 and Tables 2-5 most frequently in the text.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Reconstructing the evolutionary history relating a collection of molecular
sequences is the main subject of modern Bayesian phylogenetic inference.
However, the commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient
due to the complicated space of phylogenetic trees, especially when the number
of sequences is large. An alternative approach is variational Bayesian
phylogenetic inference (VBPI) which transforms the inference problem into an
optimization problem. While effective, the default diagonal lognormal
approximation for the branch lengths of the tree used in VBPI is often
insufficient to capture the complexity of the exact posterior. In this work, we
propose a more flexible family of branch length variational posteriors based on
semi-implicit hierarchical distributions using graph neural networks. We show
that this semi-implicit construction emits straightforward permutation
equivariant distributions, and therefore can handle the non-Euclidean branch
length space across different tree topologies with ease. To deal with the
intractable marginal probability of semi-implicit variational distributions, we
develop several alternative lower bounds for stochastic optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over baseline methods on
benchmark data examples, in terms of both marginal likelihood estimation and
branch length posterior approximation.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of the KL divergence calculation for variational inference in generative models, specifically for the case where the posterior distribution has a complex structure.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for KL divergence calculation was the use of the "reverse KL" trick, which involves computing the negative KL divergence of the approximate posterior with respect to a simpler distribution. This paper improves upon this by introducing a new algorithm that uses a combination of matrix multiplication and logarithmic operations to calculate the KL divergence more efficiently.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of their new algorithm compared to the "reverse KL" trick. They tested their algorithm on several synthetic and real-world datasets, including image generation and language modeling tasks.</p>

A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as Table 1, are referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures provide visualizations of the proposed algorithm and its performance compared to the "reverse KL" trick, while Table 1 summarizes the results of the experiments conducted.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [3] is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides the mathematical foundation for the "reverse KL" trick. The authors also provide a comparison with the "reverse KL" trick in the context of generative models.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of generative models, as more efficient KL divergence calculation can lead to faster and more accurate inference. This could be particularly important for large-scale applications where computational resources are limited.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their algorithm is not without limitations, including the potential for numerical instability and the requirement for a specific structure to the posterior distribution. They also note that their approach may not be applicable to all generative models or KL divergence calculations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this paper we construct and theoretically analyse group equivariant
convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) which are useful in understanding the
geometry of (equivariant) CNNs through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHSs). We then proceed to study the stability analysis of such
equiv-CKNs under the action of diffeomorphism and draw a connection with
equiv-CNNs, where the goal is to analyse the geometry of inductive biases of
equiv-CNNs through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).
Traditional deep learning architectures, including CNNs, trained with
sophisticated optimization algorithms is vulnerable to perturbations, including
`adversarial examples'. Understanding the RKHS norm of such models through CKNs
is useful in designing the appropriate architecture and can be useful in
designing robust equivariant representation learning models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to establish deformation stability of equivariant convolutional representations through multi-layered kernel representations, which refers to the study of generalization bounds for group equivariant convolutional neural networks (CKNs). Specifically, the authors aim to understand how the model complexity parameter λ affects the generalization bound, and how this can be used to construct CKNs with desired properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Prior to this paper, there were no known results on the generalization bounds of group equivariant convolutional neural networks. This paper provides a new upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of functions in the class of Fλ, which is a fundamental tool for studying generalization bounds. The authors show that their bound remains valid when considering CNN functions of form fσ, which are a family of functions contained in the class of Fλ.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors did not propose any specific experiments in the paper. Instead, they focused on providing theoretical insights into the generalization bounds of group equivariant convolutional neural networks.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced several figures and tables throughout the paper, but the most frequently referenced were Figures 1 and 3, and Table 2. These figures and table provide a visual representation of the upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of functions in the class of Fλ, and illustrate how this bound depends on the model complexity parameter λ and the sample size M.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited several references throughout the paper, but the most frequently cited reference was (Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, 2014), which is a seminal work on the generalization theory of neural networks. The authors use this reference to establish the upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of functions in the class of Fλ, and to understand how this bound affects the generalization capabilities of group equivariant convolutional neural networks.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: This paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it provides new insights into the generalization bounds of group equivariant convolutional neural networks, which are a fundamental component of many state-of-the-art machine learning models. By establishing a theoretical framework for understanding these generalization bounds, the authors have opened up new avenues for research and development in this area.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on the theoretical aspects of group equivariant convolutional neural networks, without providing any practical recommendations or examples of how to apply these results in practice. Additionally, the authors assume a certain level of prior knowledge about the theory of neural networks and their generalization bounds, which may not be familiar to all readers.</p>

          <p>Humans perceive and interact with the world with the awareness of
equivariance, facilitating us in manipulating different objects in diverse
poses. For robotic manipulation, such equivariance also exists in many
scenarios. For example, no matter what the pose of a drawer is (translation,
rotation and tilt), the manipulation strategy is consistent (grasp the handle
and pull in a line). While traditional models usually do not have the awareness
of equivariance for robotic manipulation, which might result in more data for
training and poor performance in novel object poses, we propose our EqvAfford
framework, with novel designs to guarantee the equivariance in point-level
affordance learning for downstream robotic manipulation, with great performance
and generalization ability on representative tasks on objects in diverse poses.</p>

A: The reference [3] is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a detailed overview of the problem of 3D shape assembly and manipulation, and discusses several approaches that have been proposed to address this problem. The authors also cite [29] and [31] frequently, as these papers propose related methods for learning dense visual affordances for object manipulation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a new framework for learning 3D geometric shape assembly and manipulation that leverages equivariance properties to improve generalization ability.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the physical origin of deformation mechanisms in random alloys
requires an understanding of their average behavior and, equally important, the
role of local fluctuations around the average. Material properties of random
alloys can be computed using direct simulations on random configurations but
some properties are very difficult to compute, for others it is not even fully
understood how to compute them using random sampling, in particular,
interaction energies between multiple defects. To that end, we develop an
atomistic model that does the averaging on the level of interatomic potentials.
Then, the problem of averaging via random sampling is bypassed since computing
material properties on random configurations reduces to computing material
properties on a single crystal, the average alloy.
  We develop our average model on the class of linear machine-learning
interatomic potentials. To that end, using tools from higher-order statistics,
we derive an analytic expansion of the average many-body per-atom energy in
terms of average tensor products of the feature vectors that scales linearly
with the size of an atomic neighborhood. In order to avoid forming higher-order
tensors composed of products of feature vectors, we develop an implementation
using equivariant tensor network potentials in which the feature vectors are
contracted to small-sized tensors before taking the average. We show that our
average model predicts the compact screw dislocation core structure in the
NbMoTaW medium-entropy alloy, in agreement with density functional theory, as
opposed to state-of-the-art average embedded atom method potentials that
predict artificial polarized cores. Hence, we anticipate that our model will
become useful for understanding mechanistic origins of material properties and
for developing predictive models of mechanical properties of random alloys.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate
solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SE) by integrating various
neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo
methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require computationally expensive
training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN
architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by
defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system.
This approach is based on a rotationally equivariant total wavefunction ansatz
that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy not only
allows for the efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential
energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration
space, but also incorporates non-BOA corrections through a single training
process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems
demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to improve the Born-Oppenheimer correction beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation for solving the full electronic-nuclear Schrödinger equation (SE) in molecular simulations. Specifically, they seek to develop a novel neural network architecture called SchrödingerNet that can efficiently capture the complex electronic and nuclear correlations in molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for Born-Oppenheimer corrections were based on post-Hartree-Fock methods, such as MP2 (second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory) or CCSD(T) (coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples). These methods are computationally expensive and often fail to capture the accuracy of full quantum mechanical calculations. The present paper introduces a deep learning approach that can potentially overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of neural networks to learn the electronic and nuclear correlations in molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors applied their SchrödingerNet architecture to several test cases, including the calculation of electronic energies for H2 and H2+, as well as the investigation of the local electronic energy and ground state energy of H2 for each MC step. They also demonstrated the ability of SchrödingerNet to capture the three-dimensional structure of the H2+ molecule by representing the total wavefunction as a function of the electron's x and y coordinates, with the electron's z coordinate fixed at zero.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figs 1, 2, and 3 the most frequently in the text, which depict the SchrödingerNet architecture, the electronic energies of H2 and H2+ as a function of internuclear distance, and the local electronic energy and ground state energy of H2 for each MC step, respectively. Table I is also referenced frequently, providing information on the hyperparameters used in the SchrödingerNet calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited the paper by Zhang et al. (2019) [36] the most frequently, which introduced the original REANN package for solving the full electronic-nuclear SE. They also cited the work by Sutton et al. (2017) [47], which reported numerical solutions for the electronic energy of H2+.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of molecular simulations, as it introduces a deep learning approach that can efficiently capture the complex electronic and nuclear correlations in molecules beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This could lead to faster and more accurate calculations of molecular properties, which are crucial in many fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledged that their approach relies on a simplifying assumption of a fixed internuclear distance, which may not be accurate for all molecules. They also noted that the computational cost of their method can be high due to the large number of parameters required for the neural network architecture. Future work could focus on improving these limitations by developing more sophisticated neural network architectures or using alternative computational methods.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Safe operation of machine learning models requires architectures that
explicitly delimit their operational ranges. We evaluate the ability of anomaly
detection algorithms to provide indicators correlated with degraded model
performance. By placing acceptance thresholds over such indicators, hard
boundaries are formed that define the model's coverage. As a use case, we
consider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves,
specifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation
Forests are shown to effectively identify contexts where prediction models are
likely to fail. Coverage/error trade-offs are evaluated under conditions of
data and concept drift. The best performance is seen when Isolation Forests

          <p>Renew interest in the charge density wave phase of TiSe$_2$ stems from the
realization of its unique driving mechanism, the so called excitonic insulator
phase. Existing claims are motivated by model calculations of the band
structure. In this study, angle resolved photoemsision spectroscopy and density
functional theory for TiSe$_2$ are directly compared. The substantial
discrepancies found between the two descriptions cast serious doubts on the
exitonic insulator scenario as the correct physical mechanism underlying the
periodic lattice distortion at low temperature. In particular, the formation of
a valence-conduction hybridization gap in the bulk band structure is not
present in the experimental data. Therefore, the origin of the structural
transition in TiSe$_2$ cannot be fully explained within the existing
theoretical models.</p>

readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite
LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton
binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for
solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different
thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker
layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms
by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures
is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide
(MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n =
3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n > 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives
comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination
processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes
dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation
(EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5,
Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their
exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative
recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping
processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping
when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n
regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is
bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Most two-dimensional (2D) materials experimentally studied so far have
hexagons as their building blocks. Only a few exceptions, such as PdSe2, are
lower in energy in pentagonal phases and exhibit pentagons as building blocks.
While theory has predicted a large number of pentagonal 2D materials, many of
them are metastable and their experimental realization is difficult. Here we
report the successful synthesis of a metastable pentagonal 2D material, the
monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, by symmetry-driven epitaxy. Scanning tunneling
microscopy and complementary spectroscopy measurements are used to characterize
the monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, which demonstrates well-ordered low-symmetry
atomic arrangements and is stabilized by lattice matching with the underlying
Pd(100) substrate. Theoretical calculations, along with angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, reveal monolayer pentagonal PdTe2 is a
semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.05 eV. Our work opens an avenue for
the synthesis of pentagon-based 2D materials and gives opportunities to explore
their applications such as multifunctional nanoelectronics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Topological magnets exhibit fascinating properties like topologically
protected surface states or anomalous transport phenomena. While these
properties can be significantly altered by manipulating the magnetic state, the
experimental verification of such predictions remains challenging. Here, we
demonstrate the efficient magnetic field control of the Weyl semimetallic state
of the collinear ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ by magneto-optical spectroscopy.
We resolve a redshift of the nodal loop resonance as the magnetization is
rotated into the kagome plane by the magnetic field. Our material-specific
theory, capturing the observed field-induced spectral reconstruction, shows the
creation of 26 Weyl points for one in-plane magnetization direction and
predicts the emergence of a gapless nodal loop for the orthogonal in-plane
magnetization orientation. These findings demonstrate that while topological
band structures are generally considered robust, breaking underlying crystal
symmetries with external fields provides an efficient way to manipulate them,
even in collinear magnets. This approach opens exciting avenues to control band
topology also in materials with more complex magnetic structures and even to
study the interplay of real- and momentum-space topological states, e.g. in
skyrmion-lattice systems.</p>

          <p>We presents an approach for early cycle classification of lithium-ion
batteries into high and low-performing categories, coupled with the prediction
of their remaining useful life (RUL) using a linear lasso technique.
Traditional methods often rely on extensive cycling and the measurement of a
large number of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequencies to
assess battery performance, which can be time and resource consuming. In this
study, we propose a methodology that leverages specific EIS frequencies to
achieve accurate classification and RUL prediction within the first few cycles
of battery operation. Notably, given only the 20 kHz impedance response, our
support vector machine (SVM) model classifies batteries with 100\% accuracy.
Additionally, our findings reveal that battery performance classification is
frequency agnostic within the high frequency ($<20$ kHz) to low-frequency (32
mHz) range. Our model also demonstrates accurate RUL predictions with
$R^2>0.96$ based on the out of phase impedance response at a single high (20
kHz) and a single mid-frequency (8.8 Hz), in conjunction with temperature data.
This research underscores the significance of the mid-frequency impedance
response as merely one among several crucial features in determining battery
performance, thereby broadening the understanding of factors influencing
battery behavior.</p>

          <p>The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an
opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum
materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on
topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via
circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not
compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces
the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation.
The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the
chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which
determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts.
Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping,
momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient
anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale,
which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe
spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into
exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree
of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.</p>

          <p>Since an ion-beam is a viable attractive alternative to other material
surface patterning techniques like an electron-beam, a study of the structure,
composition and dimension of patterned lines created on surfaces of Si and
SrTiO3 wafers with a Ga ion-beam was carried out. A combination of top-view SEM
and cross-sectional STEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy applied to the patterned
lines showed that the total ion-dose (DI) is the key parameter affecting the
characteristics of the patterned lines, which can be adjusted by the degree of
overlap between adjacent spots, beam dwell time at each spot, and the number of
beam-passes for every beam size and current. A strong dependence between the
used ion-doses and the patterned lines sizes was observed and quantified. At
higher ion-doses (DI > 10^15 ions/cm^2), the Ga ions remove part of the
material in the exposed area creating channels surrounded with amorphized
regions whereas, at lower ion-doses only amorphization occurs, creating a ridge
on the wafer surface. Further, to pattern lines with similar sizes, an order of
magnitude different ion-doses might be required in different materials as was
the case with Si and SrTiO3. The quantification of line sizes showed that with
this approach, lines as fine as 10 nm can be reproducibly patterned and

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The iron-based superconductors (IBSs) of the recently discovered 1144 class,
unlike many other IBSs, display superconductivity in their stoichiometric form
and are intrinsically hole doped. The effects of chemical substitutions with
electron donors are thus particularly interesting to investigate. Here, we
study the effect of Co substitution in the Fe site of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ single
crystals on the critical temperature, on the energy gaps, and on the superfluid
density by using transport, point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy
(PCARS), and London penetration depth measurements. The pristine compound
(T$_\mathrm{c}\simeq$ 36 K) shows two isotropic gaps whose amplitudes
($\Delta_1$ = 1.4$-$3.9 meV and $\Delta_2$ = 5.2$-$8.5 meV) are perfectly
compatible with those reported in the literature. Upon Co doping (up to
$\approx$7% Co), T$_\mathrm{c}$ decreases down to $\simeq$ 20 K, the
spin-vortex-crystal order appears, and the low-temperature superfluid density
is gradually suppressed. PCARS and London penetration depth measurements
perfectly agree in demonstrating that the nodeless multigap structure is robust
upon Co doping, while the gap amplitudes decrease as a function of
T$_\mathrm{c}$ in a linear way with almost constant values of the gap ratios
2$\Delta_i$/k$_\mathrm{B}$T$_\mathrm{c}$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The recent discovery that linearly polarized light with a helical wavefront
can exhibit vortex dichroism (also referred to as helical dichroism) has opened
up new horizons in chiroptical spectroscopy with structured chiral light.
Recent experiments have now pushed optical activity with vortex beams into the
regime of nonlinear optics. Here we present the theory of two-photon absorption
(TPA) of focused optical vortices by chiral molecules: nonlinear vortex
dichroism (NVD). We discover that highly distinct features arise in the case of
TPA with focused vortex beams, including the ability to probe chiral molecular
structure not accessible to current methods and that the differential rate of
TPA is significantly influenced by the orientation of the state of linear
polarization. This work provides strong evidence that combining nonlinear
optical activity with structured light provides new and improved routes to
studying molecular chirality.</p>

          <p>Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement
readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite
LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton
binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for
solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different
thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker
layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms
by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures
is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide
(MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n =
3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n > 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives
comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination
processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes
dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation
(EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5,
Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their
exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative
recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping
processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping
when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n
regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is
bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</p>

          <p>We introduce an experimental setup to chemically image corrosion processes at

precipitation of corrosion products in the interfacial aqueous phase can be

characterized with microscopic synchrotron-based techniques (X-ray
fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy). Moreover,
quantification of precipitates through X-ray transmission measurements provides
in-situ corrosion rates. We illustrate this setup for iron corrosion in a pH 8
electrolyte, revealing the critical role of O2 and iron diffusion in governing
the precipitation of ferrihydrite and its transformation to goethite. Corrosion
and coupled reactive transport processes can thus be monitored and
fundamentally investigated at the metal-electrolyte interface, with
micrometer-scale resolution. This capillary setup has potential applications
for in-situ corrosion studies of various metals and environments.</p>

          <p>A coherent vibrational wavepacket is launched and manipulated in the
symmetric stretch (a$_1$) mode of CBr$_4$, by impulsive stimulated Raman
scattering from non-resonant 400 nm laser pump pulses with various peak
intensities on the order of tens of 10$^{12}$ W/cm$^2$. Extreme ultraviolet
(XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) records the
wavepacket dynamics as temporal oscillations in XUV absorption energy at the
bromine M$_{4,5}$ 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges around 70 eV. The results are augmented
by nuclear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation simulations. Slopes of the
(Br-3d$_{3/2,5/2}$)$^{-1}$10a$_1^*$ core-excited state potential energy surface
(PES) along the a$_1$ mode are calculated to be -9.4 eV/{\AA} from restricted
open-shell Kohn-Sham calculations. Using analytical relations derived for the
small-displacement limit with the calculated slopes of the core-excited state
PES, a deeper insight into the vibrational dynamics is obtained by retrieving
the experimental excursion amplitude of the vibrational wavepacket and the
amount of population transferred to the vibrational first-excited state, as a
function of pump-pulse peak intensity. Experimentally, the results show that
XUV ATAS is capable of easily resolving oscillations in the XUV absorption
energy on the order of few to tens of meV and tens of femtosecond time
precision, limited only by the averaging times in the experimental scans. This
corresponds to oscillations of C-Br bond length on the order of 10$^{-4}$ to
10$^{-3}$ {\AA}. The results and the analytic relationships offer a clear
physical picture, on multiple levels of understanding, for how the pump-pulse
intensity controls the vibrational dynamics launched by non-resonant ISRS in
the small-displacement limit.</p>

They note that existing methods have limitations and may not accurately capture the behavior of certain molecules, particularly those with complex electron structures or multiple bonds.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that traditional methods for calculating polarizability rely on density functional theory (DFT) and are limited by the accuracy of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. More advanced methods, such as wavefunction-based calculations or machine learning models, have been developed but often require significant computational resources or are less generalizable to different molecules. The current work proposes a new method that combines DFT with an empirical correction scheme to improve the accuracy of polarizability predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed calculations on a set of 132 molecular species at equilibrium geometry using their proposed method. They validated the accuracy of their approach by comparing the predicted polarizabilities with experimental values whenever available.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the predicted polarizabilities using different methods, while Table 1 provides an overview of the tested molecular species. Figure 2 demonstrates the performance of the proposed method for a set of challenging molecules, and Table 2 lists the calculated polarizabilities for these molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (1) by Pople is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of the art in quantum chemistry. The authors also mention several other relevant references in the context of discussing the limitations of traditional polarizability prediction methods and the potential benefits of their proposed approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of polarizability predictions, which is an important property in many fields of chemistry and physics. They note that accurate predictions of molecular polarizabilities can help optimize chemical reactions, design new materials with specific properties, and better understand nonlinear optical processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is based on DFT, which may not always provide the most accurate predictions, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation or multiple bonds. They also mention that their proposed correction scheme is empirical and may require further refinement or validation.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I couldn't find a direct Github repository link for this paper, as it was published in a journal and not shared on Github. However, you can search for the paper's DOI (10.1063/1.451644) or title on a citation database like Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar to find a link to the paper's HTML version, which may include supplementary materials such as code repositories.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Euclid will provide deep NIR imaging to $\sim$26.5 AB magnitude over $\sim$59
deg$^2$ in its deep and auxiliary fields. The Cosmic DAWN survey complements
the deep Euclid data with matched depth multiwavelength imaging and
spectroscopy in the UV--IR to provide consistently processed Euclid selected
photometric catalogs, accurate photometric redshifts, and measurements of
galaxy properties to a redshift of $z\sim 10$. In this paper, we present an
overview of the survey, including the footprints of the survey fields, the
existing and planned observations, and the primary science goals for the
combined data set.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We use JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical
Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) survey to constrain the shape of
the nebular attenuation curve of a star-forming galaxy at z=4.41, GOODSN-17940.
We utilize 11 unblended HI recombination lines to derive the attenuation curve
spanning optical to near-infrared wavelengths (3751-9550 \r{A}). We then
leverage a high-S/N spectroscopic detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet
continuum in combination with rest-UV photometric measurements to constrain the
shape of the curve at ultraviolet wavelengths. While this UV constraint is
predominantly based on stellar emission, the large measured equivalent widths
of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ indicate that GOODSN-17940 is dominated by an
extremely young stellar population <10 Myr in age such that the UV stellar
continuum experiences the same attenuation as the nebular emission. The
resulting combined nebular attenuation curve spans 1400-9550 \r{A} and has a
shape that deviates significantly from commonly assumed dust curves in
high-redshift studies. Relative to the Milky Way, SMC, and Calzetti curves, the
new curve has a steeper slope at long wavelengths ($\lambda>5000$ \r{A}) while
displaying a similar slope across blue-optical wavelengths ($\lambda=3750-5000$
\r{A}). In the ultraviolet, the new curve is shallower than the SMC and
Calzetti curves and displays no significant 2175 \r{A} bump. This work
demonstrates that the most commonly assumed dust curves are not appropriate for
all high-redshift galaxies. These results highlight the ability to derive
nebular attenuation curves for individual high-redshift sources with deep
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, thereby improving the accuracy of physical
properties inferred from nebular emission lines.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Studies of the internal mass structure of galaxies have observed a
`conspiracy' between the dark matter and stellar components, with total (stars
$+$ dark) density profiles showing remarkable regularity and low intrinsic
scatter across various samples of galaxies at different redshifts. Such
homogeneity suggests the dark and stellar components must somehow compensate
for each other in order to produce such regular mass structures. We test the
conspiracy using a sample of 22 galaxies from the `Middle Ages Galaxy
Properties with Integral field spectroscopy' (MAGPI) Survey that targets
massive galaxies at $ z \sim 0.3$. We use resolved, 2D stellar kinematics with
the Schwarzschild orbit-based modelling technique to recover intrinsic mass
structures, shapes, and dark matter fractions. This work is the first
implementation of the Schwarzschild modelling method on a sample of galaxies at
a cosmologically significant redshift. We find that the variability of
structure for combined mass (baryonic and dark) density profiles is greater
than that of the stellar components alone. Furthermore, we find no significant
correlation between enclosed dark matter fractions at the half-light radius and
the stellar mass density structure. Rather, the total density profile slope,
$\gamma_{\mathrm{tot}}$, strongly correlates with the dark matter fraction
within the half-light radius, as $\gamma_{\mathrm{tot}} = (1.3 \pm 0.2)
f_{\mathrm{DM}} - (2.44 \pm 0.04)$. Our results refute the bulge-halo
conspiracy and suggest that stochastic processes dominate in the assembly of
structure for massive galaxies.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the impact of variable mass-to-light ratios on the dark matter fractions and global mass scaling parameters in galaxies. The authors want to know how the stellar mass profile varies within galaxies, which can affect the Schwarzschild-derived orbits and the dark matter fractions.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying the impact of variable IMFs on galaxy dynamics was limited to simple analytical models (e.g., Kormendy & Bender 2012). This paper improves upon that by using a more sophisticated model, the MAGPI, which can accurately capture the complex stellar mass profiles of galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed simulations using the MAGPI model to test how varying the IMF within a galaxy affects the dark matter fractions and global mass scaling parameters. They artificially steepened the stellar mass profile in one of their models to explore the potential impact of a variable IMF on these quantities.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the MAGPI model results for different galaxies and highlight the impact of a variable IMF on the dark matter fractions. Table 1 is also important, as it presents the initial conditions for the simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference to Martín-Navarro et al. (2014) is cited the most frequently, as it provides a framework for understanding how the IMF affects galaxy dynamics. The reference to Conroy et al. (2017) is also important, as it suggests that massive galaxies tend to have dwarf-rich centers, which could impact the stellar mass profile and dark matter fractions.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could be impactful in shedding light on the complex relationship between the IMF and galaxy dynamics. If the results are confirmed by future observations, they could have implications for our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over time.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness is that the study focuses on a single galaxy model, which may not be representative of all galaxies. Additionally, the authors assume a constant mass-to-light ratio for the dwarf population, which could be oversimplifying the complexities of this population.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM
spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the
Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are
selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and
cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of
the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint
galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\gtrsim6-8$), high redshift AGN
($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty
galaxies ($1\lesssim z \lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling
redshift--color--magnitude space from $z\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks
across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam
parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M,
F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST
coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We
successfully observed 553 objects down to
$m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we
reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the
success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the
rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our
targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14
additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of
$M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly
release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along
with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Sulphur-bearing species play crucial roles in interstellar chemistry, yet
their precise characterisation remains challenging. Here, we present laboratory
experiments aimed at extending the high-resolution spectroscopy of protonated
carbonyl sulphide (HOCS$^+$), a recently detected molecular ion in space. Using
a frequency-modulated free-space absorption spectrometer, we detected
rotational transitions of HOCS$^+$ in an extended negative glow discharge with
a mixture of H$_2$ and OCS, extending the high-resolution rotational
characterisation of the cation well into the millimetre wave region (200-370
GHz). Comparisons with prior measurements and quantum chemical calculations
revealed an overall agreement in the spectroscopic parameters. With the new
spectroscopic dataset in hand, we re-investigated the observations of HOCS$^+$
towards G+0.693-0.027, which were initially based solely on K$_a$ = 0 lines
contaminated by HNC$^{34}$S. This re-investigation enabled the detection of
weak K$_a$ = 0 transitions, free from HNC$^{34}$S contamination. Our
high-resolution spectroscopic characterisation also provides valuable insights
for future millimetre and submillimetre astronomical observations of these
species in different interstellar environments. In particular, the new
high-resolution catalogue will facilitate the search for this cation in cold
dark clouds, where very narrow line widths are typically observed.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to study the rotational transitions of the HOCS+ molecule, which are not well understood due to its complex structure and the lack of accurate laboratory measurements.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for studying HOCS+ transitions was based on theoretical calculations, but these predictions were not accurate enough to be used in astronomical observations. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by providing laboratory measurements of HOCS+ transitions, which are essential for testing theoretical models and interpreting astronomical observations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale
because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying
membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry,
photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate
a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (L21 DR3 corrections applied).
Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and
it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a
cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where
consensus exists.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the distance scale of the Cepheid variable stars in the Milky Way galaxy using new observations and improved distance ladder.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies relied on the distance scale from the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method, which had a large uncertainty due to the lack of accurate distances to the nearby galaxies. This paper improved upon the previous state of the art by using new observations and a more robust distance ladder to determine the distance scale of Cepheid variables in the Milky Way.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors observed a sample of Cepheid variable stars in the Milky Way using telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory and the Gemini North telescope, and obtained new photometric and spectroscopic data for these targets. They also used a Bayesian approach to determine the distance scale based on the observations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5, and tables 2 and 4 are referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures and tables show the observed relations between the Cepheid variables and other distance indicators, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and the horizontal branch (HB), which are used to determine the distance scale of Cepheid variables.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides the basis for the new distance scale determination. The authors also cited [2-4] to support their methodology and [5-7] to provide context on the previous state of the art in distance determinations for Cepheid variables.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper provides a more accurate distance scale for Cepheid variable stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the galaxy. The improved distance scale can also be used to study the properties of Cepheid variables in different galaxies and to test models of galaxy formation and evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method relies on a number of assumptions and approximations, such as the accuracy of the TRGB distance scale and the uniformity of the Cepheid variable stars in the sample. They also note that future observations with higher precision and better spatial resolution will be needed to further refine the distance scale determination.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm
eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and
elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for some five
million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants stars) in the Milky
Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe
Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. These estimates are obtained
through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters
and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal
Component Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by
J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or
better than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a
wide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and
0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the
influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity
estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now
been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H]
$\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and
giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the
exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an analysis of JWST Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy of $z\gtrsim6.5$
galaxies, using observations in the public archive covering galaxies in four
independent fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, Abell 2744, EGS). We measure Ly$\alpha$
emission line properties for a sample of $210$ $z\simeq6.5-13$ galaxies, with
redshifts confirmed independently of Ly$\alpha$ in all cases. We present $3$
new detections of Ly$\alpha$ emission in JWST spectra, including a large
equivalent width (EW $=143\ \r{A}$) Ly$\alpha$ emitter with strong CIV emission
(EW $=21\ \r{A}$) at $z=7.1$ in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent
Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Ly$\alpha$
emission (EW $>25\ \r{A}$) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs,
suggesting that the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons decreases by $4\times$
between $z\simeq5$ and $z\simeq9$. We describe potential implications for the
IGM neutral fraction. There is significant field to field variance in the
Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS
shows no evidence for reduced transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons at
$z\simeq7-8$, suggesting a significantly ionized sightline may be present in
the field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the FRESCO survey to
characterize overdensities on large scales around known Ly$\alpha$ emitters in
the GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely
strong Ly$\alpha$ detections (EW $>50\ \r{A}$) in most cases. Future Ly$\alpha$
spectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized
regions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the
reionization process.</p>

A: The reference to "Pan et al. (2019)" was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed description of the DeepClass architecture and its training process. The reference to "Sanchez et al. (2016)" was also cited frequently, as it discusses the use of CNNs for galaxy classification and provides a comparison with the DeepClass model.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of galaxy classification tasks, which are crucial for understanding the structure and evolution of galaxies. The proposed DeepClass architecture can be applied to a wide range of applications, including large-scale surveys and space missions.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors note that their model is computationally efficient but may not be as accurate as more complex models that use additional features or techniques. Additionally, they acknowledge that their dataset is limited to a specific redshift range and may not be representative of all galaxy populations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>CXOU J005245.0-722844 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
that has long been known as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) star, containing an OBe
main sequence star and a compact object. In this paper, we report on a new very
fast X-ray outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844. X-ray observations taken by
Swift constrain the duration of the outburst to less than 16 days and find that
the source reached super-Eddington X-ray luminosities during the initial phases
of the eruption. The XRT spectrum of CXOU J005245.0-722844 during this outburst
reveals a super-soft X-ray source, best fit by an absorbed thermal blackbody
model. Optical and Ultraviolet follow-up observations from the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert
System (ATLAS), and Swift identify a brief ~0.5 magnitude optical burst
coincident with the X-ray outburst that lasted for less than 7 days. Optical
photometry additionally identifies the orbital period of the system to be 17.55
days and identifies a shortening of the period to 17.14 days in the years
leading up to the outburst. Optical spectroscopy from the Southern African
Large Telescope (SALT) confirms that the optical companion is an early-type OBe
star. We conclude from our observations that the compact object in this system
is a white dwarf (WD), making this the seventh candidate Be/WD X-ray binary.
The X-ray outburst is found to be the result of a very-fast, ultra-luminous
nova similar to the outburst of MAXI J0158-744.</p>

          <p>The Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a proposed space
observatory which will use arrays of thousands of kinetic inductance detectors
(KIDs) to perform low- and moderate-resolution spectroscopy throughout the
far-infrared. The detectors must have noise equivalent powers (NEPs) at or
below 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) to be subdominant to noise from sky backgrounds and
thermal noise from PRIMA's cryogenically cooled primary mirror. Using a Radio
Frequency System on a Chip for multitone readout, we measure the NEPs of
detectors on a flight-like array designed to observe at a wavelength of 210
microns. We find that 92% of the KIDs measured have an NEP below 0.1
aW/sqrt(Hz) at a noise frequency of 10 Hz.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The search for earth-like exoplanets with the Doppler radial velocity
technique is an extremely challenging and multifaceted precision spectroscopy
problem. Currently, one of the limiting instrumental factors in reaching the
required long-term $10^{-10}$ level of radial velocity precision is the
defect-driven sub-pixel quantum efficiency variations in the large-format
detector arrays used by precision echelle spectrographs. Tunable frequency comb
calibration sources that can fully map the point spread function across a
spectrograph's entire bandwidth are necessary for quantifying and correcting
these detector artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate a combination of laser
frequency and mode spacing control that allows full and deterministic
tunability of a 30 GHz electro-optic comb together with its filter cavity.
After supercontinuum generation, this gives access to any optical frequency
across 700 - 1300 nm. Our specific implementation is intended for the comb
deployed at the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph and its near-infrared
Hawaii-2RG array, but the techniques apply to all laser frequency combs used
for precision astronomical spectrograph calibration and other applications that
require broadband tuning.</p>

consider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves,
specifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are
identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral
analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains
a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from
fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as
ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a
framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral
fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal
human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line
surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By
comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%.

          <p>Q: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a new method for identifying molecular lines in spectral observations, specifically in the context of interstellar medium (ISM) studies. The authors aim to improve upon previous methods by using a combination of peak matching and χ2 loss functions to identify relevant molecular lines.</p>
          <p>A: Previously, the state of the art for identifying molecular lines in spectral observations was based on the use of line fitting techniques, such as the "spectral line-fitting" method proposed by Belloche et al. (2013). However, this method has limitations, particularly when dealing with complex spectra or high levels of noise. The current study improves upon these methods by using a combination of peak matching and χ2 loss functions to identify relevant molecular lines.</p>
          <p>Q: The proposed experiments involved the use of a Github repository containing the data and scripts for carrying out the analysis. The authors used a variety of spectral observations from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISRO) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to test their method.</p>
          <p>A: Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20, and Figure 21 were referenced most frequently in the text. These figures demonstrate the results of the analysis using different methods and observational data sets.</p>

          <p>A: The paper is potentially impactful or important due to its novel approach to identifying molecular lines in spectral observations, which could lead to improved accuracy and efficiency in ISM studies. Additionally, the use of a Github repository for sharing data and scripts could promote collaboration and reproducibility in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Some weaknesses of the paper include the potential for subjective interpretations of the peak matching criteria and the sensitivity of the χ2 loss function to the choice of prior probabilities.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are
identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral
analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains
a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from
fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as
ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a
framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral
fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal
human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line
surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By
comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%.
Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In drug discovery, predicting the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of small-molecule drugs is critical
for ensuring safety and efficacy. However, the process of accurately predicting
these properties is often resource-intensive and requires extensive
experimental data. To address this challenge, we propose SMILES-Mamba, a
two-stage model that leverages both unlabeled and labeled data through a
combination of self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. The
model first pre-trains on a large corpus of unlabeled SMILES strings to capture
the underlying chemical structure and relationships, before being fine-tuned on
smaller, labeled datasets specific to ADMET tasks. Our results demonstrate that
SMILES-Mamba exhibits competitive performance across 22 ADMET datasets,
achieving the highest score in 14 tasks, highlighting the potential of
self-supervised learning in improving molecular property prediction. This
approach not only enhances prediction accuracy but also reduces the dependence
on large, labeled datasets, offering a promising direction for future research
in drug discovery.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic test. Conventional
task-specific ECG analysis models require large numbers of expensive ECG
annotations or associated labels to train. Transfer learning techniques have
been shown to improve generalization and reduce reliance on labeled data. We
present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a
comprehensive study performed on a dataset of 1.66 million ECGs sourced from
both publicly available and private institutional sources. ECG-FM adopts a
transformer-based architecture and is pretrained on 2.5 million samples using
ECG-specific augmentations and contrastive learning, as well as a continuous
signal masking objective. Our transparent evaluation includes a diverse range
of downstream tasks, where we predict ECG interpretation labels, reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction, and abnormal cardiac troponin. Affirming
ECG-FM's effectiveness as a foundation model, we demonstrate how its command of
contextual information results in strong performance, rich pretrained
embeddings, and reliable interpretability. Due to a lack of open-weight
practices, we highlight how ECG analysis is lagging behind other medical
machine learning subfields in terms of foundation model adoption. Our code is

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various
real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is
essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and
efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and
travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating
such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior
are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract
efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel
purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments
traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw
spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from
complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments.
  To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of
efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient
modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable
model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while
being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate
efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware
pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of
trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding
process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with
several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the
effectiveness of PTrajM. Code is available at

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the problem of trajectory prediction, which is the task of predicting the future locations and velocities of objects based on their past movements. The authors propose a novel approach called PreCLN, which leverages pre-trained language models to learn a compact representation of vehicles' trajectories and improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, the previous state of the art in trajectory prediction is based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and requires a large amount of training data to achieve good performance. In contrast, PreCLN does not require any additional training data and can learn from raw GPS data directly. The paper shows that PreCLN achieves better performance than the previous state of the art in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct an experiment using real-world GPS data to evaluate the performance of PreCLN. They compare PreCLN with several baseline methods, including a random walk model and a GCN-based method. The results show that PreCLN significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

A: The paper cites several references related to GCNs, language models, and trajectory prediction. These references are cited to provide a better understanding of the proposed approach and its relationship to existing research in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to impact the field of traffic forecasting and route planning by providing a novel approach to trajectory prediction that can learn from raw GPS data directly without requiring additional training data. This could lead to more accurate and efficient trajectory prediction, which could have practical applications in various industries such as transportation and logistics.</p>

          <p>Adversarial examples pose a significant challenge to the robustness,
reliability and alignment of deep neural networks. We propose a novel,
easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to
adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input
representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions.
We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness
to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a
robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call
\textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution
inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data,
reaching an adversarial accuracy of $\approx$72% (CIFAR-10) and $\approx$48%
(CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite ($L_\infty=8/255)$ with a
finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable
with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best
current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on
top, we get $\approx$78% on CIFAR-10 and $\approx$51% on CIFAR-100, improving
SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder
dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide
insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the
hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based
attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target
classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our
multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into
controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on
large vision language models.</p>

They also varied the number of ensemble members and the attack strength to evaluate the robustness of their method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 24 and 25 are mentioned the most frequently in the text, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble method against adversarial attacks. Figure 24 shows examples of optimizing towards all 100 CIFAR-10 classes using a multi-resolution ResNet152 model, while Figure 25 compares the robust accuracy of different types of self-ensembles on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has
gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential.
Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power
generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this
approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of
linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the
ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains
questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its
training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach
for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of
linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic
information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by
training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level
classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free
retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG
encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this
paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of
the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG
segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its
ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory
nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for
providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample
opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including
demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep
learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence
dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for
various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex
hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate
temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous
variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity
consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to
model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems.
PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal
encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous
variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy.
Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework
consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which
enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the
discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn
generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario
datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive
ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within
the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets,
PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization
ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot
experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>To address the challenge of limited experimental materials data, extensive
physical property databases are being developed based on high-throughput
computational experiments, such as molecular dynamics simulations. Previous
studies have shown that fine-tuning a predictor pretrained on a computational
database to a real system can result in models with outstanding generalization
capabilities compared to learning from scratch. This study demonstrates the
scaling law of simulation-to-real (Sim2Real) transfer learning for several
machine learning tasks in materials science. Case studies of three prediction
tasks for polymers and inorganic materials reveal that the prediction error on
real systems decreases according to a power-law as the size of the
computational data increases. Observing the scaling behavior offers various
insights for database development, such as determining the sample size
necessary to achieve a desired performance, identifying equivalent sample sizes
for physical and computational experiments, and guiding the design of data
production protocols for downstream real-world tasks.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new method for molecular design, specifically a Bayesian molecular design framework that incorporates both quantum chemical and thermodynamic constraints. The authors seek to improve upon existing methods by combining these two types of constraints in a single framework.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, existing molecular design methods often rely on either quantum chemical or thermodynamic constraints alone, but not both. The proposed method, Bayesian Molecular Design (BMD), integrates these two types of constraints in a single framework, allowing for more accurate and efficient design. This improvement over previous methods is achieved through the use of a Bayesian approach, which allows for the incorporation of uncertainties in the predictions and enables the design process to take into account the limitations of both quantum chemistry and thermodynamics.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper presents several case studies demonstrating the application of the BMD framework to different design problems. These include the design of a new agrochemical, the optimization of a drug-like molecule, and the prediction of the solubility of a target molecule. In each case, the authors use the BMD framework to incorporate both quantum chemical and thermodynamic constraints into the design process.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The paper references several figures and tables throughout the text, but the most frequently cited are Figures 2, 3, and 4, which demonstrate the performance of the BMD framework compared to existing methods. Table 1 is also frequently referenced, as it provides a summary of the different types of constraints that can be incorporated into the BMD framework.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to quantum chemistry and thermodynamics, with the most frequent being the papers by Klamt and coworkers on the COSMO-RS method. These citations are given in the context of discussing the limitations of existing molecular design methods and the potential benefits of integrating quantum chemical and thermodynamic constraints.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a new framework for molecular design that incorporates both quantum chemical and thermodynamic constraints, which could lead to more accurate and efficient design of small molecules. The Bayesian approach used in the method allows for the incorporation of uncertainties in the predictions, making the design process more robust and reliable. Additionally, the use of a single framework for both types of constraints could simplify the design process and reduce the computational cost compared to existing methods that rely on separate software packages for each type of constraint.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is computationally intensive, which may limit its applicability for large-scale design projects. Additionally, they note that the accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the input data and the choice of prior distributions used in the Bayesian approach.</p>

          <p>While high-performing language models are typically trained on hundreds of
billions of words, human children become fluent language users with a much
smaller amount of data. What are the features of the data they receive, and how
do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this
question, we train GPT-2 models on 29M words of English-language child-directed
speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to a
heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate both the
syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired
evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global
developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training
data support high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties
of the data affect model results, but somewhat surprisingly, global properties
do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training
language models. These findings support the hypothesis that, rather than
proceeding from better data, children's learning is instead substantially more
efficient than current language modeling techniques.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We are considering in this paper the task of label-efficient fine-tuning of
segmentation models: We assume that a large labeled dataset is available and
allows to train an accurate segmentation model in one domain, and that we have
to adapt this model on a related domain where only a few samples are available.
We observe that this adaptation can be done using two distinct methods: The
first method, supervised pretraining, is simply to take the model trained on
the first domain using classical supervised learning, and fine-tune it on the
second domain with the available labeled samples. The second method is to
perform self-supervised pretraining on the first domain using a generic pretext
task in order to get high-quality representations which can then be used to
train a model on the second domain in a label-efficient way. We propose in this
paper to fuse these two approaches by introducing a new pretext task, which is
to perform simultaneously image denoising and mask prediction on the first
domain. We motivate this choice by showing that in the same way that an image
denoiser conditioned on the noise level can be considered as a generative model
for the unlabeled image distribution using the theory of diffusion models, a
model trained using this new pretext task can be considered as a generative
model for the joint distribution of images and segmentation masks under the
assumption that the mapping from images to segmentation masks is deterministic.
We then empirically show on several datasets that fine-tuning a model
pretrained using this approach leads to better results than fine-tuning a
similar model trained using either supervised or unsupervised pretraining only.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>To address the challenge of limited experimental materials data, extensive
physical property databases are being developed based on high-throughput
computational experiments, such as molecular dynamics simulations. Previous
studies have shown that fine-tuning a predictor pretrained on a computational
database to a real system can result in models with outstanding generalization
capabilities compared to learning from scratch. This study demonstrates the
scaling law of simulation-to-real (Sim2Real) transfer learning for several
machine learning tasks in materials science. Case studies of three prediction
tasks for polymers and inorganic materials reveal that the prediction error on
real systems decreases according to a power-law as the size of the
computational data increases. Observing the scaling behavior offers various
insights for database development, such as determining the sample size
necessary to achieve a desired performance, identifying equivalent sample sizes
for physical and computational experiments, and guiding the design of data
production protocols for downstream real-world tasks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures
have been proposed recently to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD);
however, perplexingly, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal.
We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks
(GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of
GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for
protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the
underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing
expressivity at the expense of generalization. We also investigate this
possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical
surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for
labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model
achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and
affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to
reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High-content phenotypic screening, including high-content imaging (HCI), has
gained popularity in the last few years for its ability to characterize novel
therapeutics without prior knowledge of the protein target. When combined with
deep learning techniques to predict and represent molecular-phenotype
interactions, these advancements hold the potential to significantly accelerate
and enhance drug discovery applications. This work focuses on the novel task of
HCI-guided molecular design. Generative models for molecule design could be
guided by HCI data, for example with a supervised model that links molecules to
phenotypes of interest as a reward function. However, limited labeled data,
combined with the high-dimensional readouts, can make training these methods
challenging and impractical. We consider an alternative approach in which we
leverage an unsupervised multimodal joint embedding to define a latent
similarity as a reward for GFlowNets. The proposed model learns to generate new
molecules that could produce phenotypic effects similar to those of the given
image target, without relying on pre-annotated phenotypic labels. We
demonstrate that the proposed method generates molecules with high
morphological and structural similarity to the target, increasing the
likelihood of similar biological activity, as confirmed by an independent
oracle model.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a novel approach for generating high-quality molecular structures with desired properties using a fragment-based generation framework. The authors aim to address the limitation of traditional molecular design methods, which often rely on trial-and-error experiments or manual design by experts, and instead propose a data-driven approach that leverages large-scale simulations and machine learning models to generate optimal molecular structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in fragment-based molecule generation was based on using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as deep Q-networks (DQNs) and policy gradients. However, these methods were limited by their inability to handle complex reward functions and the large number of possible combinations of fragments. The paper proposes a new approach called geometric multimodal contrastive (GMC) learning, which leverages contrastive learning to learn a representation space that captures the desired properties of molecules. This approach improves upon the previous state of the art by enabling the generation of high-quality molecular structures with complex topologies and functional groups.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper proposes several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the GMC learning framework for fragment-based molecule generation. These include: (1) training a GMC model on a synthetic dataset of molecular structures to demonstrate the ability of the framework to learn useful representations; (2) using the trained GMC model to generate new molecular structures with desired properties, and evaluating their quality using various metrics such as druglikeness and bioactivity; (3) comparing the performance of the GMC model with other state-of-the-art methods in fragment-based generation, including reinforcement learning and graph convolutional networks (GCNs); (4) investigating the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the GMC model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-5 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the paper. Figure 1 provides an overview of the GMC learning framework, while Figures 2-4 demonstrate the ability of the model to learn useful representations of molecular structures. Table 1 lists the hyperparameters used for training the GMC model, and Tables 2 and 3 provide details on the hyperparameters used for the other methods compared in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [31] is cited the most frequently in the paper, particularly in the context of fragment-based molecule generation and the use of large-scale simulations for drug discovery. Other relevant references include [53] for the graph attention transformer architecture used in the GFlowNet model, and [40] for the use of deep learning models in molecular design.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important due to its novel approach to fragment-based molecule generation, which leverages large-scale simulations and machine learning models to generate optimal molecular structures with desired properties. The proposed GMC learning framework could potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery efforts by enabling the design of new drugs with complex topologies and functional groups. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the potential of contrastive learning for learning useful representations of molecular structures, which could have implications for other applications in chemistry and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: Some potential weaknesses of the paper include the limited scope of the experiments, which focused primarily on fragment-based generation without exploring other aspects of molecular design such as structure prediction or property optimization. Additionally, the choice of reward function used in the GMC model may not capture all possible desired properties of molecules, which could limit the effectiveness of the approach. Finally, the paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the computational cost and scalability of the proposed method, which could be an important consideration for large-scale simulations.</p>

          <p>In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn interpretable
topological features of biomolecular data and demonstrate the efficacy of
parsimonious models trained on topological features in predicting the stability
of synthetic mini proteins. We compare models that leverage
automatically-learned structural features against models trained on a large set
of biophysical features determined by subject-matter experts (SME). Our models,
based only on topological features of the protein structures, achieved 92%-99%
of the performance of SME-based models in terms of the average precision score.
By interrogating model performance and feature importance metrics, we extract
numerous insights that uncover high correlations between topological features
and SME features. We further showcase how combining topological features and
SME features can lead to improved model performance over either feature set
used in isolation, suggesting that, in some settings, topological features may
provide new discriminating information not captured in existing SME features
that are useful for protein stability prediction.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular representation is a foundational element in our understanding of
the physical world. Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical
reactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular
machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features,
and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse
representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the
molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work
introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into
molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit
addition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the
performance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore,
stereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a
tailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any
downstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned
representations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously
intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular
design.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce a protein language model for determining the complete sequence
of a peptide based on measurement of a limited set of amino acids. To date,
protein sequencing relies on mass spectrometry, with some novel edman
degregation based platforms able to sequence non-native peptides. Current
protein sequencing techniques face limitations in accurately identifying all
amino acids, hindering comprehensive proteome analysis. Our method simulates
partial sequencing data by selectively masking amino acids that are
experimentally difficult to identify in protein sequences from the UniRef
database. This targeted masking mimics real-world sequencing limitations. We
then modify and finetune a ProtBert derived transformer-based model, for a new
downstream task predicting these masked residues, providing an approximation of
the complete sequence. Evaluating on three bacterial Escherichia species, we
achieve per-amino-acid accuracy up to 90.5% when only four amino acids ([KCYM])
are known. Structural assessment using AlphaFold and TM-score validates the
biological relevance of our predictions. The model also demonstrates potential
for evolutionary analysis through cross-species performance. This integration
of simulated experimental constraints with computational predictions offers a
promising avenue for enhancing protein sequence analysis, potentially
accelerating advancements in proteomics and structural biology by providing a
probabilistic reconstruction of the complete protein sequence from limited
experimental data.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) has become a trending topic in data
science and engineering. However, the key technique of TDA, i.e., persistent
homology, is defined on point cloud data, which restricts its scope. In this
work, we propose persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacian, or persistent Hodge
Laplacian (PHL) for abbreviation, for the TDA on manifolds with boundaries, or
volumetric data. Specifically, we extended the evolutionary de Rham-Hodge
theory from the Lagrangian formulation to the Eulerian formulation via
structure-persevering Cartesian grids, and extended the persistent Laplacian on
point clouds to persistent (de Rham-)Hodge Laplacian on nested families of
manifolds with appropriate boundary conditions. The proposed PHL facilitates
the machine learning and deep learning prediction of volumetric data. For a
proof-of-principle application of the proposed PHL, we propose a persistent
Hodge Laplacian learning (PHLL) algorithm for data on manifolds or volumetric
data. To this end, we showcase the PHLL prediction of protein-ligand binding
affinities in two benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments highlight the
power and promise of PHLL.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The assembly of proteins in membranes plays a key role in many crucial
cellular pathways. Despite their importance, characterizing transmembrane
assembly remains challenging for experiments and simulations. Equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample
the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely on enhanced
sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of transmembrane proteins along a
collective variable that should encode all slow degrees of freedom. However,
given the complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is far from
trivial, with the consequence that free energy profiles of dimerization can be
poorly converged. Here, we introduce an alternative approach, which relies only
on simulating short, dynamically unbiased trajectory segments, avoiding using
collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all trajectories, we obtain
free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of transmembrane dimerization with
the same set of simulations. We showcase our algorithm by sampling the
spontaneous association and dissociation of a transmembrane protein in a lipid
bilayer, the popular coarse-grained Martini force field. Our algorithm
represents a promising way to investigate assembly processes in biologically
relevant membranes, overcoming some of the challenges of conventional methods.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Matter-wave interferometry with molecules is intriguing both because it
demonstrates a fundamental quantum phenomenon and because it opens avenues to
quantum-enhanced measurements in physical chemistry. One great challenge in
such experiments is to establish matter-wave beam splitting mechanisms that are
efficient and applicable to a wide range of particles. In the past, continuous
standing light waves in the visible spectral range were used predominantly as
phase gratings, while pulsed vacuum ultraviolet light found applications in
photo-ionisation gratings. Here, we explore the regime of continuous, intense
deep-ultraviolet ($\rm >1 MW/cm^2$, $\rm 266\,nm$) light masks, where a rich
variety of photo-physical and photo-chemical phenomena and relaxation pathways
must be considered. The improved understanding of the mechanisms in this
interaction opens new potential pathways to protein interferometry and to
matter-wave enhanced sensing of molecular properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Capitalizing on the recent availability of ERA5 monthly averaged long-term
data records of mean atmospheric and climate fields based on high-resolution
reanalysis, deep-learning architectures offer an alternative to physics-based
daily numerical weather predictions for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) and
annual means. A novel Deep UNet++-based Ensemble (DUNE) neural architecture is
introduced, employing multi-encoder-decoder structures with residual blocks.
When initialized from a prior month or year, this architecture produced the
first AI-based global monthly, seasonal, or annual mean forecast of 2-meter
temperatures (T2m) and sea surface temperatures (SST). ERA5 monthly mean data
is used as input for T2m over land, SST over oceans, and solar radiation at the
top of the atmosphere for each month of 40 years to train the model. Validation
forecasts are performed for an additional two years, followed by five years of
forecast evaluations to account for natural annual variability. AI-trained
inference forecast weights generate forecasts in seconds, enabling ensemble
seasonal forecasts. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation
Coefficient (ACC), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) statistics are presented
globally and over specific regions. These forecasts outperform persistence,
climatology, and multiple linear regression for all domains. DUNE forecasts
demonstrate comparable statistical accuracy to NOAA's operational monthly and
seasonal probabilistic outlook forecasts over the US but at significantly
higher resolutions. RMSE and ACC error statistics for other recent AI-based
daily forecasts also show superior performance for DUNE-based forecasts. The
DUNE model's application to an ensemble data assimilation cycle shows
comparable forecast accuracy with a single high-resolution model, potentially
eliminating the need for retraining on extrapolated datasets.</p>

          <p>Satellite images have become increasingly valuable for modelling regional
climate change effects. Earth surface forecasting represents one such task that
integrates satellite images with meteorological data to capture the joint
evolution of regional climate change effects. However, understanding the
complex relationship between specific meteorological variables and land surface
evolution poses a significant challenge. In light of this challenge, our paper
introduces a pipeline that integrates principles from both perturbation-based
explainability techniques like LIME and global marginal explainability
techniques like PDP, besides addressing the constraints of using such
techniques when applying them to high-dimensional spatiotemporal deep models.
The proposed pipeline simplifies the undertaking of diverse investigative
analyses, such as marginal sensitivity analysis, marginal correlation analysis,
lag analysis, etc., on complex land surface forecasting models In this study we
utilised Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) as the surface
forecasting model and did analyses on the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI) of the surface forecasts, since meteorological variables like
temperature, pressure, and precipitation significantly influence it. The study
area encompasses various regions in Europe. Our analyses show that
precipitation exhibits the highest sensitivity in the study area, followed by
temperature and pressure. Pressure has little to no direct effect on NDVI.
Additionally, interesting nonlinear correlations between meteorological
variables and NDVI have been uncovered.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector
to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon
emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be
programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands
and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle
on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to
the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We
address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using
multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network
decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of
dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US
metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find
that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide
intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety,
and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel
and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50%
of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of
intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the
composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably
across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful
strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of
eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle
electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly,
this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such
as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution
strategies.</p>

          <p>Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very
expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple
emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly
map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate
their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular
benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep
learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We
implement a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and find
that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation
model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved surface-level climate
variables. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly
linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. We identify that
this outcome is a result of high levels of internal variability in the
benchmark targets. To address internal variability, we update the benchmark
targets with ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model that contain 50
instead of 3 climate simulations per emission pathway. Using the new targets,
we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on
temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based model for
emulating precipitation. We publish our code, data, and an interactive tutorial
at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial
for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such
predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense
spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems,
which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An
alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid
and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which
approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the
coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure
modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from
expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more
fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models
suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how
large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We
propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure
model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a
coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and
physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural
operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid
that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term
statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a
120x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 5\%$. In contrast, the
closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $58$x slower than PINO while
having a much higher error $\sim205\%$ when the closure model is trained on the
same FRS dataset.</p>

          <p>Understanding the causal interaction of time series variables can contribute
to time series data analysis for many real-world applications, such as climate
forecasting and extreme weather alerts. However, causal relationships are
difficult to be fully observed in real-world complex settings, such as
spatial-temporal data from deployed sensor networks. Therefore, to capture
fine-grained causal relations among spatial-temporal variables for further a
more accurate and reliable time series analysis, we first design a conceptual
fine-grained causal model named TBN Granger Causality, which adds
time-respecting Bayesian Networks to the previous time-lagged Neural Granger
Causality to offset the instantaneous effects. Second, we propose an end-to-end
deep generative model called TacSas, which discovers TBN Granger Causality in a
generative manner to help forecast time series data and detect possible
anomalies during the forecast. For evaluations, besides the causality discovery
benchmark Lorenz-96, we also test TacSas on climate benchmark ERA5 for climate
forecasting and the extreme weather benchmark of NOAA for extreme weather
alerts.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Studying low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world
is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems.
While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could
enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails
associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes. Due to
computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles
(comprised of 1,000-10,000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical
models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations
with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles. In Part I,
we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on Spherical Fourier
Neural Operators (SFNO), and we discuss important design decisions for
constructing such an ensemble. The ensemble represents model uncertainty
through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition
uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest growing modes of the
forecast. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation
pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics. Using
large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve
calibrated probabilistic forecasts. As the trajectories of the individual
members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time,
consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble
members' spectra stay constant with lead time. Therefore, these members
simulate realistic weather states, and the ML ensemble thus passes a crucial
spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar Extreme
Forecast Indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are
reliable and discriminating.</p>

          <p>Climate change not only threatens agricultural producers but also strains
financial institutions. These important food system actors include government
entities tasked with both insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response
to continued global warming. We use an artificial neural network to predict
future maize yields in the U.S. Corn Belt, finding alarming changes to
institutional risk exposure within the Federal Crop Insurance Program.
Specifically, our machine learning method anticipates more frequent and more
severe yield losses that would result in the annual probability of Yield
Protection (YP) claims to more than double at mid-century relative to
simulations without continued climate change. Furthermore, our dual finding of
relatively unchanged average yields paired with decreasing yield stability
reveals targeted opportunities to adjust coverage formulas to include
variability. This important structural shift may help regulators support grower
adaptation to continued climate change by recognizing the value of
risk-reducing strategies such as regenerative agriculture. Altogether, paired
with open source interactive tools for deeper investigation, our risk profile

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>While the added value of machine learning (ML) for weather and climate
applications is measurable, explaining it remains challenging, especially for
large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose
that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately
determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help
understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in
atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging
from semi-empirical models with minimal tunable parameters (simplest) to deep
learning algorithms (most complex). First, in cloud cover parameterization, we
find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover
and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features
such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation
of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation
that rivals the performance of deep learning models. Second, we establish a ML
model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the
importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing
absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we
emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling
the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding
environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution
spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation
parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with
existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by
hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the
trustworthiness of ML models in atmospheric applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon refers to an indirect pathway of CO2
utilization. Among them, the conversion of CO2 with green H2 to sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF) with high energy density has gained much attention. It
offers a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the fossil
fuel crises, and transform a climate killer into valuable products. However,
this low-carbon technology is intrinsically complicated. It involves the
development of a catalyst, the design of a reaction system, and its operation
and product refining. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical process
of CO2 hydrogenation in the reactor. In this study, numerical simulations of a
fixed bed catalytic reactor for CO2-to-SAF conversion are conducted by coupling
CFD with heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the catalytic surface. The heat
and mass transfer between the catalyst surface and surrounding fluid flow are
resolved in the simulation. A detailed understanding of the reacting flow and
catalytic processes is obtained from this study. The impact of operating
parameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, and the ratio between
CO2 and H2, is also explored, which provides important insights into the
catalytic reactor design and operation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability
of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and
on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations.
We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly
influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0)
state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the
high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) > 3 eV. Interaction with the
Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state
transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both
HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely
aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence
of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These
findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in
[Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the electronic structure and properties of transition metal complexes with a focus on the LS state, which is an important but poorly understood electronic state in these complexes. The authors aim to fill this knowledge gap by using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods to study the LS state of [Fe(tpy-ph)2]2+ in both gas phase and on Au substrate.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in understanding the electronic structure of transition metal complexes involved the use of density functional theory (DFT) and other ab initio methods, which provided a good starting point for understanding the LS state. However, these methods have limitations when dealing with complexes that exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling and other correlated electron effects. The current paper improves upon these methods by using a hybrid functional approach that includes both Hartree-Fock and DFT components, which provides a more accurate description of the electronic structure of the LS state.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements on [Fe(tpy-ph)2]2+ in both gas phase and on Au substrate to investigate the electronic structure of the LS state. They also used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support their experimental findings and provide a more detailed understanding of the electronic structure of the LS state.</p>

A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides a summary of the electronic structure of the LS state, while Figures 2 and 3 show the XAS measurements on the gas phase and Au substrate, respectively. Table 1 lists the experimental conditions for the XAS measurements, and Table 2 compares the theoretical and experimental results for the LS state.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [3] by Shaver et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a detailed overview of the electronic structure and properties of transition metal complexes with a focus on the LS state. The authors also cite [29] by Hla et al., which provides a comprehensive review of the theoretical methods used to study the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful or important because it provides new insights into the electronic structure and properties of transition metal complexes with a focus on the LS state, which is an understudied electronic state in these systems. The hybrid functional approach used in the paper improves upon previous methods by providing a more accurate description of the electronic structure of the LS state, and the experimental measurements provide new data that can be used to support theoretical calculations and improve our understanding of these complexes.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a specific hybrid functional approach that may not be applicable to all transition metal complexes. Additionally, the experimental measurements are limited to the gas phase and Au substrate, which may not be representative of all possible environments in which these complexes can exist.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies had shown that the absorption coefficient and refractive index of GaN, AlN, and AlGaN alloys could be measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. However, these techniques were limited to a narrow range of wavelengths and did not provide detailed information on the optical properties of these materials. The present paper employs a more advanced technique based on Raman spectroscopy, which allows for a more comprehensive measurement of the absorption coefficient and refractive index over a wider range of wavelengths.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Hyperspectral imaging techniques have a unique ability to probe the
inhomogeneity of material properties whether driven by compositional variation
or other forms of phase segregation. In the doped cuprates, iridates, and
related materials, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)
measurements have found the emergence of pseudogap 'puddles' from the
macroscopically Mott insulating phase with increased doping. However,
categorizing this hyperspectral data by electronic order is not trivial, and
has often been done with ad hoc methods. In this paper we demonstrate the
utility of $k$-means, a simple and easy-to-use unsupervised clustering method,
as a tool for classifying heterogeneous scanning tunneling spectroscopy data by
electronic order for Rh-doped Sr$_2$IrO$_{4}$, a cuprate-like material. Applied
to STM data acquired within the Mott phase, $k$-means successfully identified
areas of Mott order and of pseudogap order. The unsupervised nature of
$k$-means limits avenues for bias, and provides clustered spectral shapes
without a priori knowledge of the physics. Additionally, we demonstrate
successful use of $k$-means as a preprocessing tool to constrain
phenomenological function fitting. Clustering the data allows us to reduce the
fitting parameter space, limiting over-fitting. We suggest $k$-means as a fast,
simple model for processing hyperspectral data on materials of mixed electronic
order.</p>

A: The reference [1] by N. H. Sung et al. is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides background information on the crystal growth and intrinsic magnetic behavior of Sr2IrO4. The authors also cite this reference when discussing the previous state of the art in STM/STS measurements of 18% Rh-doped Sr2IrO4 at 4.5 K.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful as it provides new insights into the electronic structure of correlated electron systems, which are materials that exhibit unique electronic behavior due to their complex arrangement of electrons. By extending previous STM/STS measurements to a higher temperature (77 K), the authors gain insight into how the electronic structure of these materials changes with temperature, which could have implications for the development of new electronic devices.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on visual analysis of spectra to identify any remaining Mott-like behavior in the electronic structure of 18% Rh-doped Sr2IrO4 at these temperatures. While this method can be effective, it may not provide a complete picture of the electronic structure of the material, particularly if there are any subtle features that are not easily visible to the naked eye.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New ground-based and space-based photometric data have been obtained and
archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of three detached
early-type and southern-hemisphere eccentric eclipsing binaries GM Nor (P =
1.88 d, e = 0.05), V397 Pup (3.00, 0.30), and PT Vel (1.80, 0.12). Their TESS
observations in several sectors have also been included and the corresponding
light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. As a result, new accurate
photoelectric times of minimum light have been obtained. The newly completed
O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature
and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values for the
elements of apsidal motion were obtained. Using ESO archive spectroscopy, for
V397 Pup, the precise absolute parameters were newly derived: M1 = 3.076(35)
M$\odot$, M2 = 2.306(35) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.711(55) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.680(55)
R$\odot$. For PT Vel the absolute dimensions were improved: M1 = 2.204(25)
M$\odot$, M2 = 1.638(25) M$\odot$, and R1 = 2.108(30) R$\odot$, R2 = 1.605(30)
R$\odot$. For GM Nor, the less accurate absolute parameters based on the light
curve analysis were evaluated: M1 = 1.94(15) M$\odot$, M2 = 1.84(14) M$\odot$,
and R1 = 2.27(20) R$\odot$, R2 = 2.25(20) R$\odot$. We found more precise and
relatively short periods of apsidal motion of about 80, 335, and 160 years,
along with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.524,
-2.361, and -2.563, for GM Nor, V397 Pup, and PT Vel, respectively.
Relativistic effects are small but not negligible, making up to 10\% of the
total apsidal motion rate in all systems. No marks of the presence of the third
body were revealed in the light curves, on the O-C diagrams, or in the reduced
spectra of the eccentric systems studied here.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type
1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a
binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high
inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There
is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which
precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this
paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2
years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and
refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts
are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average
$e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously
found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in
orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not
eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni
profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to
transient absorption.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Current strategies for achieving fine-grained prosody control in speech
synthesis entail extracting additional style embeddings or adopting more
complex architectures. To enable zero-shot application of pretrained
text-to-speech (TTS) models, we present PRESENT (PRosody Editing without Style
Embeddings or New Training), which exploits explicit prosody prediction in
FastSpeech2-based models by modifying the inference process directly. We apply
our text-to-prosody framework to zero-shot language transfer using a JETS model
exclusively trained on English LJSpeech data. We obtain character error rates
(CER) of 12.8%, 18.7% and 5.9% for German, Hungarian and Spanish respectively,
beating the previous state-of-the-art CER by over 2x for all three languages.
Furthermore, we allow subphoneme-level control, a first in this field. To
evaluate its effectiveness, we show that PRESENT can improve the prosody of
questions, and use it to generate Mandarin, a tonal language where vowel pitch
varies at subphoneme level. We attain 25.3% hanzi CER and 13.0% pinyin CER with
the JETS model. All our code and audio samples are available online.</p>

          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of Paraformer on several benchmark datasets. They compared the quality and generation rates of Paraformer with those of WaveNet and other state-of-the-art TTS systems.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 2 and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the paper, as they show the comparison of Paraformer with other state-of-the-art TTS systems in terms of quality and generation rates. Table 1 is also important, as it shows the configuration of the Paraformer model used in the experiments.</p>

A: The paper cites several references related to TTS systems and parallel transformer architectures. One of the most frequently cited references is the work by Oord et al. (2016) on WaveNet, which provides a high-quality speech generation model but at the cost of slow generation rates. The authors also cite several other works related to parallel transformer architectures and their applications in TTS systems.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful or important because it proposes a new architecture called Paraformer that improves upon WaveNet in terms of both quality and generation rates. This could have significant implications for real-world applications of TTS systems, such as voice assistants, speech-to-text systems, and audiobooks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses mainly on the quality and generation rates of Paraformer without providing a comprehensive evaluation of other aspects of TTS systems, such as robustness to input noise or variability in speaking style. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for Paraformer, which could be an important factor in practical deployments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Learning from Label Proportion (LLP) is a weakly supervised learning scenario
in which training data is organized into predefined bags of instances,
disclosing only the class label proportions per bag. This paradigm is essential
for user modeling and personalization, where user privacy is paramount,
offering insights into user preferences without revealing individual data. LLP
faces a unique difficulty: the misalignment between bag-level supervision and
the objective of instance-level prediction, primarily due to the inherent
ambiguity in label proportion matching. Previous studies have demonstrated deep
representation learning can generate auxiliary signals to promote the
supervision level in the image domain. However, applying these techniques to
tabular data presents significant challenges: 1) they rely heavily on
label-invariant augmentation to establish multi-view, which is not feasible
with the heterogeneous nature of tabular datasets, and 2) tabular datasets
often lack sufficient semantics for perfect class distinction, making them
prone to suboptimality caused by the inherent ambiguity of label proportion
matching.
  To address these challenges, we propose an augmentation-free contrastive
framework TabLLP-BDC that introduces class-aware supervision (explicitly aware
of class differences) at the instance level. Our solution features a two-stage
Bag Difference Contrastive (BDC) learning mechanism that establishes robust
class-aware instance-level supervision by disassembling the nuance between bag
label proportions, without relying on augmentations. Concurrently, our model
presents a pioneering multi-task pretraining pipeline tailored for
tabular-based LLP, capturing intrinsic tabular feature correlations in
alignment with label proportion distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that TabLLP-BDC achieves state-of-the-art performance for LLP in the tabular
domain.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and
memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However,
training LLMs on human-written text entails significant risk of privacy and
copyright violations, which demands an efficient machine unlearning framework
to remove knowledge of sensitive data without retraining the model from
scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is widely used for unlearning by reducing
the likelihood of generating unwanted information, the unboundedness of
increasing the cross-entropy loss causes not only unstable optimization, but
also catastrophic forgetting of knowledge that needs to be retained. We also
discover its joint application under low-rank adaptation results in
significantly suboptimal computational cost vs. generative performance
trade-offs. In light of this limitation, we propose two novel techniques for
robust and cost-efficient unlearning on LLMs. We first design an Inverted Hinge
loss that suppresses unwanted tokens by increasing the probability of the next
most likely token, thereby retaining fluency and structure in language
generation. We also propose to initialize low-rank adapter weights based on
Fisher-weighted low-rank approximation, which induces faster unlearning and
better knowledge retention by allowing model updates to be focused on
parameters that are important in generating textual data we wish to remove.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of memorization in language models, particularly in the context of unsupervised learning. The authors observe that existing unsupervised learning methods often rely on memorization, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. They aim to develop a method that can unlearn the memorized information while preserving the underlying patterns and relationships.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in unsupervised learning for language models was the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs). These methods have shown promising results in unsupervised learning tasks, but they are not designed to handle memorization explicitly. The paper proposes a novel approach that combines the strengths of VAEs and GANs with the ability to unlearn memorized information.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed method. They use a text generation task as the benchmark, where the model is trained on a large corpus of text and then evaluated on its ability to generate new text that is similar to the training data. They compare the performance of their method with and without unlearning, and analyze the impact of different parameters on the results.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The most frequently referenced figures are Figures 1, 2, and 3, which provide an overview of the proposed method and its performance compared to previous methods. Figure 4 is also important, as it shows the impact of unlearning on the model's ability to generate new text that is similar to the training data.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the area of unsupervised learning. By developing a method that can unlearn memorized information while preserving the underlying patterns and relationships, the authors aim to improve the performance of language models on a wide range of tasks. This could lead to more accurate and robust language models that are better able to handle complex and dynamic language use.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a specific assumption about the nature of memorization in language models, which may not always hold true. Additionally, the proposed method may not be effective in all cases, particularly when the memorized information is highly salient or when the model has a limited capacity for unlearning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in
microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology,
such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of
new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have
limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage
proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and
the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the
unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we
propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the
modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the
latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual
information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by
6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking
homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly
accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying
688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with
known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our
understanding of newly discovered phages.</p>

          <p>Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of
conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and
entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the
generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of
pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B1, Llama-2-7B2, Llama-3-8B3, and
gemma-7B4, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly
available.5 Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a
relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We
retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation
of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even
with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to
established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and
ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and
quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses
employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore,
we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available,
fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational
biology.</p>

          <p>Accurate prediction of enzyme function is crucial for elucidating biological
mechanisms and driving innovation across various sectors. Existing deep
learning methods tend to rely solely on either sequence data or structural data
and predict the EC number as a whole, neglecting the intrinsic hierarchical
structure of EC numbers. To address these limitations, we introduce MAPred, a
novel multi-modality and multi-scale model designed to autoregressively predict
the EC number of proteins. MAPred integrates both the primary amino acid
sequence and the 3D tokens of proteins, employing a dual-pathway approach to
capture comprehensive protein characteristics and essential local functional
sites. Additionally, MAPred utilizes an autoregressive prediction network to
sequentially predict the digits of the EC number, leveraging the hierarchical
organization of EC classifications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets,
including New-392, Price, and New-815, demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing models, marking a significant advance in the reliability and
granularity of protein function prediction within bioinformatics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Topological deep learning (TDL) facilitates learning from data represented by
topological structures. The primary model utilized in this setting is
higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which extends traditional graph
message-passing neural networks (MPNN) to diverse topological domains. Given
the significant expressivity limitations of MPNNs, our paper aims to explore
both the strengths and weaknesses of HOMP's expressive power and subsequently
design novel architectures to address these limitations. We approach this from
several perspectives: First, we demonstrate HOMP's inability to distinguish
between topological objects based on fundamental topological and metric
properties such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. Second, we
show HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging the topological structure of
objects constructed using common lifting and pooling operators on graphs.
Finally, we compare HOMP's expressive power to hypergraph networks, which are
the most extensively studied TDL methods. We then develop two new classes of
TDL models: multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable multi-cellular networks
(SMCN). These models draw inspiration from expressive graph architectures.
While MCN can reach full expressivity but is highly unscalable, SMCN offers a
more scalable alternative that still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity
limitations. Finally, we construct a synthetic dataset, where TDL models are
tasked with separating pairs of topological objects based on basic topological
properties. We demonstrate that while HOMP is unable to distinguish between any
of the pairs in the dataset, SMCN successfully distinguishes all pairs,
empirically validating our theoretical findings. Our work opens a new design
space and new opportunities for TDL, paving the way for more expressive and
versatile models.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to prove that there exists an MCN (Multi-Cellular Neural) model that can simulate any k-IGN (k-Ignition Network) update on a given adjacency matrix A. Specifically, the authors want to show that the MCN model can compute the linear function L(h) for any linear map L and any element h in the space Q, which is equivariant with respect to the action of the symmetric group Sn.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon the previous work on MCN models for graph neural networks, which were shown to be able to simulate any IGN update on a given adjacency matrix. However, the previous state of the art did not allow for simulating k-IGN updates, which are more general and can have different properties than IGN updates. The paper improves upon this by showing that MCN models can indeed simulate k-IGN updates, which expands their capabilities beyond IGN updates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose running experiments to demonstrate the ability of MCN models to simulate k-IGN updates on various adjacency matrices.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is
challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories
and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1)
Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it
crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure
efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and
select the most critical temporal information within the extended context
provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG
representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular
Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to
encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is
then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph,
where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from
the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic
link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of
computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal
dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of temporal graph neural networks (TGNs) for link prediction tasks by modeling an increasing number of temporal neighbors with limited total training time.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for TGNs is achieved by CAWN, which models a large number of temporal neighbors to capture long-range dependencies. However, CAWN is computationally expensive and cannot be trained within a limited time frame. This paper proposes DyGMamba, which improves upon CAWN's performance while reducing the total training time.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct experiments on the Enron dataset to evaluate the performance of five TGN models with increasing numbers of temporal neighbors. They fix the patch size of DyGFormer and DyGMamba to 1 to maximize input sequence lengths and set a time limit of 120 minutes for the total training time. They also compare the performance of these models with other state-of-the-art methods, including CAWN, TGN, and CTAN.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 3, 4, and 5 are referenced frequently in the text, as they show the performance comparison of different models under different training conditions. Table 1 is also important as it provides a summary of the best hyperparameters found in the previous study (Yu et al., 2023).</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Yu et al. (2023)" is cited several times in the paper, particularly in the context of discussing previous work on TGNs and their performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful as it improves upon the state-of-the-art performance of TGNs while reducing the total training time. This makes it more practical and efficient for real-world applications where computational resources are limited.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed method, DyGMamba, may not be able to capture long-range dependencies as effectively as CAWN due to its reduced computational complexity. However, they argue that this tradeoff is necessary for practical applications where time efficiency is crucial.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent advances in machine learning have led to foundation models for
atomistic materials chemistry, potentially enabling quantum-accurate
descriptions of interatomic forces at reduced computational cost. These models
are benchmarked by predicting materials' properties over large databases;
however, these computationally intensive tests have been limited to basic
quantities related to harmonic phonons, leaving uncertainty about the
reliability for complex, technologically and experimentally relevant anharmonic
heat-conduction properties. Here we present an automated framework that relies
on foundation models to compute microscopic vibrational properties, and employs
them within the Wigner formulation of heat transport to predict the macroscopic
thermal conductivity in solids with arbitrary composition and structure. We
apply this framework with the foundation models M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and
SevenNET to 103 diverse compounds, comparing predictions against
first-principles references and introducing a benchmark metric based on
conductivity. This framework paves the way for physics-aware, accurate
predictions of vibrational and thermal properties, and for uncovering materials
that violate semiclassical Boltzmann transport and feature exceptional
heat-shielding or thermoelectric performance.</p>

          <p>Vibrational spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for molecular
characterization and offers an ideal target for the computational investigation
of molecular materials. Building on previous comprehensive assessments of
efficient methods for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, this study investigates the
predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of gas-phase IR spectra
calculations, accessible through a combination of modern semiempirical quantum
mechanical and transferable machine learning potentials. A composite approach
for IR spectra prediction based on the doubly-harmonic approximation, utilizing
harmonic vibrational frequencies in combination squared derivatives of the
molecular dipole moment, is employed. This approach allows for methodical
flexibility in the calculation of IR intensities from molecular dipoles and the
corresponding vibrational modes. Various methods are systematically tested to
suggest a suitable protocol with an emphasis on computational efficiency. Among
these methods, semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) models, classical
charge equilibrium models, and machine learning potentials trained for dipole
moment prediction are assessed across a diverse dataset of organic molecules.
We particularly focus on the recently reported machine learning potential
MACE-OFF23 to address the accuracy limitations of conventional low-cost quantum
mechanical and force-field methods. This study aims to establish a standard for
the efficient computational prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the rapid
and reliable identification of unknown compounds and advancing automated
analytical workflows in chemistry.</p>

Orion Source I (SrcI) on ~12 to 20 AU scales. Our observations show that the

from SrcI which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular
outflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggests that the

evolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels
material between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into
the outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks which excite the NaCl
close to the disk surface.</p>

          <p>Hemodynamic quantities are valuable biomedical risk factors for
cardiovascular pathology such as atherosclerosis. Non-invasive, in-vivo
measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of
modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow
field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks
that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the
amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using
moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico
datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current
standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the
popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the
physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the
involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid
arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic
flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation
between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models
obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows
that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI
data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p>
