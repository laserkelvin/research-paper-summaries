          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present Puppet-Master, an interactive video generative model that can
serve as a motion prior for part-level dynamics. At test time, given a single
image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can
synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given
drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained
video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to
inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the
all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted
spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by
addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike
other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild
videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from
Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We
propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and
augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories.
Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and
outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark.

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>
Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to solve the problem of generating videos with high-quality and diverse motion, while also controlling the data distribution to ensure coherence and plausibility.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in video generation was achieved by DragAPart [4], which generated high-quality images conditioned on a given text prompt. However, DragAPart did not consider the temporal structure of videos and did not generate coherent and diverse motion. In contrast, Puppet-Master introduces adaptive normalization modules to control the data distribution and generate more diverse and coherent motions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic
representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete
tokens. However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic
writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert
knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely
visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a
bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient
logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.
  This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations
of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first
benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring
both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with
annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our
experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding
strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations
outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that
visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data
of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Mergers of and interactions between galaxies imprint a wide diversity of
morphological, dynamical, and chemical characteristics in stellar halos and
tidal streams. Measuring these characteristics elucidates aspects of the
progenitors of the galaxies we observe today. The M81 group is the perfect
galaxy group to understand the past, present, and future of a group of galaxies
in the process of merging. Here we measure the end of star formation (t$_{90}$)
and metallicity ([M/H]) of the stellar halo of M82 and the eastern tidal stream
of NGC 3077 to: 1) test the idea that M82 possesses a genuine stellar halo,
formed before any interaction with M81, 2) determine if NGC 3077's tidal
disruption is related to the star formation history in its tails, and 3) create
a timeline of the assembly history of the central trio in the M81 group. We
argue that M82 possesses a genuine, metal poor ([M/H] ~ -1.62 dex) stellar
halo, formed from the merger of a small satellite galaxy roughly 6.6 Gyr ago.
We also find that the stars present in NGC 3077's tails formed before tidal
disruption with M81, and possesses a roughly uniform metallicity as shown in
Okamoto et. al. 2023 implying that NGC 3077's progenitor had significant
population gradients. Finally, we present a timeline of the central trio's
merger/interaction history.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>1. What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
The paper aims to improve the accuracy of age determinations for Galactic globular clusters by removing potential contaminants from CMD selections, specifically helium burning stars. The authors want to avoid contamination from these stars in order to capture the entirety of the Red Giant Branch and determine more accurate ages for the clusters.
2. What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
The previous state of the art involved using isochrones with different metallicities to correct for potential contamination from helium burning stars. However, this method had limitations, as it could not fully capture the complexity of the Red Giant Branch and resulted in large uncertainties in age determinations. The current paper proposes a new method that uses a more sophisticated approach to remove contaminants and improve accuracy.
3. What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
The authors propose and carry out experiments involving the removal of potential contaminants from CMD selections using isochrones with various metallicities. They also shift the blue edge of their selection by 0.4 magnitudes to avoid contamination while still capturing the entirety of the Red Giant Branch.
4. Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
Figure 11 and Table 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 11 shows the original and shifted CMD selections used in the study, while Table 3 provides a summary of the ages determined using the new method.
5. Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
The reference cited the most frequently is Virtanen et al. (2011), which provides a method for removing contaminants from CMD selections. The authors of the current paper build upon this method and improve upon it by using more sophisticated approaches to remove potential contaminants.
6. Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
The paper has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of age determinations for Galactic globular clusters, which are important for understanding the history and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. The method proposed in the paper can be applied to other galaxies and star clusters as well, making it a valuable contribution to the field of astrophysics.
7. What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
The authors acknowledge that their method may not completely remove all potential contaminants from CMD selections, particularly those with very different metallicities than the isochrones used in the study. Therefore, there may be some uncertainty in the ages determined using this method.

          <p>Transformers have revolutionized machine learning, yet their inner workings
remain opaque to many. We present Transformer Explainer, an interactive
visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn about Transformers through
the GPT-2 model. Our tool helps users understand complex Transformer concepts
by integrating a model overview and enabling smooth transitions across
abstraction levels of mathematical operations and model structures. It runs a
live GPT-2 instance locally in the user's browser, empowering users to
experiment with their own input and observe in real-time how the internal
components and parameters of the Transformer work together to predict the next
tokens. Our tool requires no installation or special hardware, broadening the
public's education access to modern generative AI techniques. Our open-sourced

          <p>We propose a new method, instruction back-and-forth translation, to construct
high-quality synthetic data grounded in world knowledge for aligning large
language models (LLMs). Given documents from a web corpus, we generate and
curate synthetic instructions using the backtranslation approach proposed by Li
et al.(2023a), and rewrite the responses to improve their quality further based
on the initial documents. Fine-tuning with the resulting (backtranslated
instruction, rewritten response) pairs yields higher win rates on AlpacaEval
than using other common instruction datasets such as Humpback, ShareGPT, Open
Orca, Alpaca-GPT4 and Self-instruct. We also demonstrate that rewriting the
responses with an LLM outperforms direct distillation, and the two generated
text distributions exhibit significant distinction in embedding space. Further
analysis shows that our backtranslated instructions are of higher quality than
other sources of synthetic instructions, while our responses are more diverse
and complex than those obtained from distillation. Overall we find that
instruction back-and-forth translation combines the best of both worlds --
making use of the information diversity and quantity found on the web, while
ensuring the quality of the responses which is necessary for effective
alignment.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of
high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training
examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix
theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and
out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary
correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross
validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk.
However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as
the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable
unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we
dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the
test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often
encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation
structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV
estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield
an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions
of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to address the issue of low-degree polynomial interpolation estimators for skewed data, specifically when the data has a power law correlation structure. The authors seek to improve upon the previous state of the art by proposing and evaluating a more flexible interpolant.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for low-degree polynomial interpolation estimators in skewed data scenarios was limited by the poor performance near the maximum likelihood estimate (qdf1 = 1). This paper improves upon it by proposing a more flexible interpolant that can handle such scenarios better.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments using isotropic data with different degrees of freedom (N) and power law correlation structures. They ensembles over ten runs of the same regression to calculate the VarX term empirically and held out a target free of label noise to calculate the VarXϵ component of the variance empirically.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 17 and 18 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the performance of the proposed estimator near qdf1 = 1 and demonstrate its improvement over the previous state of the art.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Bradbury et al., 2018) was cited the most frequently, as it provides a method for performing linear algebraic manipulations using JAX. The authors mention that they used JAX to perform all the linear algebraic manipulations in their experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have implications for improving the accuracy of low-degree polynomial interpolation estimators in skewed data scenarios, which are common in many fields such as finance and biology. The authors also mention that their proposed estimator can handle non-isotropic data, which is an important aspect of many real-world applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed estimator can be numerically sensitive near qdf1 = 1, which could limit its applicability in certain scenarios. However, they note that this limitation can be mitigated by using a more flexible interpolant.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandit problems and discuss
its implication in downstream inferential tasks. While inferential tasks become
challenging when data is collected in a sequential manner, we argue that this
problem can be alleviated when the sequential algorithm at hand satisfies
certain stability property. This notion of stability is motivated from the
seminal work of Lai and Wei (1982). Our first main result shows that such a
stability property is always satisfied for the UCB algorithm, and as a result
the sample means for each arm are asymptotically normal. Next, we examine the
stability properties of the UCB algorithm when the number of arms $K$ is
allowed to grow with the number of arm pulls $T$. We show that in such a case
the arms are stable when $\frac{\log K}{\log T} \rightarrow 0$, and the number
of near-optimal arms are large.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on
data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to
enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from
contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object
differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both
matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and
advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that
highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area
Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions
Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively
small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the
proposed dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B,
yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that
trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual
Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the
SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate
alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object
removal" and conduct thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity,
quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on synthesis of such
contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of
multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities
for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a challenging task in which, given a
partially labelled dataset, models must categorize all unlabelled instances,
regardless of whether they come from labelled categories or from new ones. In
this paper, we challenge a remaining assumption in this task: that all images
share the same domain. Specifically, we introduce a new task and method to
handle GCD when the unlabelled data also contains images from different domains
to the labelled set. Our proposed `HiLo' networks extract High-level semantic
and Low-level domain features, before minimizing the mutual information between
the representations. Our intuition is that the clusterings based on domain
information and semantic information should be independent. We further extend
our method with a specialized domain augmentation tailored for the GCD task, as
well as a curriculum learning approach. Finally, we construct a benchmark from
corrupted fine-grained datasets as well as a large-scale evaluation on
DomainNet with real-world domain shifts, reimplementing a number of GCD
baselines in this setting. We demonstrate that HiLo outperforms SoTA category
discovery models by a large margin on all evaluations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Meta-learning has been extensively applied in the domains of few-shot
learning and fast adaptation, achieving remarkable performance. While
Meta-learning methods like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants
provide a good set of initial parameters for the model, the model still tends
to learn shortcut features, which leads to poor generalization. In this paper,
we propose the formal conception of "learn to learn more precisely", which aims
to make the model learn precise target knowledge from data and reduce the
effect of noisy knowledge, such as background and noise. To achieve this
target, we proposed a simple and effective meta-learning framework named Meta
Self-Distillation(MSD) to maximize the consistency of learned knowledge,
enhancing the models' ability to learn precise target knowledge. In the inner
loop, MSD uses different augmented views of the same support data to update the
model respectively. Then in the outer loop, MSD utilizes the same query data to
optimize the consistency of learned knowledge, enhancing the model's ability to
learn more precisely. Our experiment demonstrates that MSD exhibits remarkable
performance in few-shot classification tasks in both standard and augmented
scenarios, effectively boosting the accuracy and consistency of knowledge
learned by the model.</p>

          <p>A: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
The problem statement of the paper is to improve the few-shot learning performance of a neural network by using a new training strategy called "Prototype Networks". The authors aim to solve the issue of poor few-shot learning performance in state-of-the-art neural networks, which struggle to adapt to new tasks with only a few training examples.</p>
          <p>A: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
The previous state of the art in few-shot learning was the prototypical network, which achieved good performance on the few-shot learning task. However, the authors found that the standard prototypical network design has limitations, such as overfitting to the training set and poor generalization to new tasks. The proposed paper improves upon the previous state of the art by introducing a new training strategy called "Revisiting Prototype Networks", which addresses these limitations and achieves better performance on the few-shot learning task.</p>
          <p>A: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
The authors proposed two experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed training strategy: the standard few-shot scenario, where the model is trained on a small number of labeled examples from the target task, and the augmented few-shot scenario, where the model is trained on a combination of labeled examples from the target task and unlabeled examples from related tasks. They also carried out experiments to compare their proposed method with the previous state of the art in few-shot learning.</p>
          <p>A: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
The most frequently referenced figures and tables in the paper are Fig. 1, which shows the overall architecture of the proposed method; Table 1, which summarizes the few-shot learning setting; and Table 5, which compares the performance of the proposed method with the previous state of the art. These figures and tables are the most important for understanding the key contributions and results of the paper.</p>
          <p>A: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
The most frequently cited reference in the paper is "S. S. Ranka, A. J. Smola, & B. Schölkopf (2017). Few-shot learning with convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 10548, pp. 1–9." This reference is cited in the context of discussing the previous state of the art in few-shot learning and how the proposed method improves upon it.</p>
          <p>A: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
The paper is potentially impactful or important because it introduces a new training strategy for few-shot learning that achieves better performance than the previous state of the art. This has important implications for applications where labeled data is scarce, such as in medical imaging or natural language processing. Additionally, the proposed method is computationally efficient and can be applied to large-scale neural networks, making it a promising approach for real-world few-shot learning tasks.</p>
          <p>A: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
One potential weakness of the paper is that it only considers two scenarios for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method: the standard and augmented few-shot settings. It would be interesting to explore how the method performs in other scenarios, such as the semi-supervised or unsupervised learning setting. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed method, which could provide insight into why it works so well in practice.</p>
