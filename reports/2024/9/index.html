          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With the emergence of Foundational Machine Learning Interatomic Potential
(FMLIP) models trained on extensive datasets, transferring data between
different ML architectures has become increasingly important. In this work, we
examine the extent to which training data optimised for one machine-learning
forcefield algorithm may be re-used to train different models, aiming to
accelerate FMLIP fine-tuning and to reduce the need for costly iterative
training. As a test case, we train models of an organic liquid mixture that is
commonly used as a solvent in rechargeable battery electrolytes, making it an
important target for reactive MLIP development. We assess model performance by
analysing the properties of molecular dynamics trajectories, showing that this
is a more stringent test than comparing prediction errors for fixed datasets.
We consider several types of training data, and several popular MLIPs - notably
the recent MACE architecture, a message-passing neural network designed for
high efficiency and smoothness. We demonstrate that simple training sets
constructed without any ab initio dynamics are sufficient to produce stable
models of molecular liquids. For simple neural-network architectures, further
iterative training is required to capture thermodynamic and kinetic properties
correctly, but MACE performs well with extremely limited datsets. We find that
configurations designed by human intuition to correct systematic model
deficiencies transfer effectively between algorithms, but active-learned data
that are generated by one MLIP do not typically benefit a different algorithm.
Finally, we show that any training data which improve model performance also
improve its ability to generalise to similar unseen molecules. This suggests
that trajectory failure modes are connected with chemical structure rather than
being entirely system-specific.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advances in lithium-metal anodes have inspired interest in discovery of
Li-free cathodes, most of which are natively found in their charged state. This
is in contrast to today's commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes, which are
more stable in their discharged state. In this study, we combine calculated
cathode voltage information from both categories of cathode materials, covering
5577 and 2423 total unique structure pairs, respectively. The resulting voltage
distributions with respect to the redox pairs and anion types for both classes
of compounds emphasize design principles for high-voltage cathodes, which favor
later Period 4 transition metals in their higher oxidation states and more
electronegative anions like fluorine or polyaion groups. Generally, cathodes
that are found in their charged, delithiated state are shown to exhibit
voltages lower than those that are most stable in their lithiated state, in
agreement with thermodynamic expectations. Deviations from this trend are found
to originate from different anion distributions between redox pairs. In
addition, a machine learning model for voltage prediction based on chemical
formulae is constructed, and shows state-of-the-art performance when compared
to two established composition-based ML models for materials properties
predictions, Roost and CrabNet.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more
recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of
generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal
structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level
instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate
crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate
end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization
problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for
controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language
model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates
intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and
(2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and
generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally
uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from
the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three
components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible
structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of
directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user
request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able
to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels,
solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more
complex structure generation in near future.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution
of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to
obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated
by the detection of ice absorption features towards the edge-on HH 48 NE disk
as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new
radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and
mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret
the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed towards the HH 48 NE disk. We show that
the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping
in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure vs. polar vs.
apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages,
implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution
of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk,
and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can
dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore
imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing
planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will
fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.</p>

The authors also cite "Friedrich et al. (2018)" and "Leblanc et al. (2016)" to provide additional context and support for their proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper's proposed method has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of Mars' atmospheric composition, as it takes into account the variations in the atmosphere across different locations and times. This could have important implications for future missions to Mars, as well as for our understanding of the planet's climate and geology.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>There has been much recent interest in designing symmetry-aware neural
networks (NNs) exhibiting relaxed equivariance. Such NNs aim to interpolate
between being exactly equivariant and being fully flexible, affording
consistent performance benefits. In a separate line of work, certain structured
parameter matrices -- those with displacement structure, characterized by low
displacement rank (LDR) -- have been used to design small-footprint NNs.
Displacement structure enables fast function and gradient evaluation, but
permits accurate approximations via compression primarily to classical
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a general
framework -- based on a novel construction of symmetry-based structured
matrices -- to build approximately equivariant NNs with significantly reduced
parameter counts. Our framework integrates the two aforementioned lines of work
via the use of so-called Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the
modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design
of structured matrices -- resembling LDR matrices -- which generalize the
linear operations of a classical CNN from cyclic groups to general finite
groups and their homogeneous spaces. We show that GMs can be employed to extend
all the elementary operations of CNNs to general discrete groups. Further, the
theory of structured matrices based on GMs provides a generalization of LDR
theory focussed on matrices with cyclic structure, providing a tool for
implementing approximate equivariance for discrete groups. We test GM-based
architectures on a variety of tasks in the presence of relaxed symmetry. We
report that our framework consistently performs competitively compared to
approximately equivariant NNs, and other structured matrix-based compression
frameworks, sometimes with a one or two orders of magnitude lower parameter
count.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a novel formulation for the design of light-weight approximately equivariant CNNs, which balances data and model equivariance errors. The authors aim to provide a competitive balance between these two types of errors, as previous approaches have focused primarily on one or the other.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous work in approximately equivariant CNNs has focused on adding soft equivariance regularization during training to control the error. However, this approach can lead to a large number of parameters and a complex optimization landscape, which can negatively impact performance. The authors propose a new formulation that combines the flexibility of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the symmetry constraints of group theory, resulting in a more balanced trade-off between data and model equivariance errors.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neural functional networks (NFNs) have recently gained significant attention
due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network
generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural
representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in
neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered
arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take
into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\operatorname{ReLU}$ networks,
and the weight sign flipping symmetries of $\operatorname{sin}$ or
$\operatorname{tanh}$ networks. In this paper, we extend the study of the group
action on the network weights from the group of permutation matrices to the
group of monomial matrices by incorporating scaling/sign-flipping symmetries.
Particularly, we encode these scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our
corresponding equivariant and invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs
the Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks
(Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has
much fewer independent trainable parameters compared to the baseline NFNs in
the literature, thus enhancing the model's efficiency. Moreover, for fully
connected and convolutional neural networks, we theoretically prove that all
groups that leave these networks invariant while acting on their weight spaces
are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group. We provide empirical evidences
to demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing baselines, achieving
competitive performance and efficiency.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for
ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning
has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems
is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation
and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete
measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep
unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel
block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized
model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors
and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to
decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep
network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the
regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian
approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to
per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while
maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation
equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance,
we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation
of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep
network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms
reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p>

          <p>Steerable networks, which process data with intrinsic symmetries, often use
Fourier-based nonlinearities that require sampling from the entire group,
leading to a need for discretization in continuous groups. As the number of
samples increases, both performance and equivariance improve, yet this also
leads to higher computational costs. To address this, we introduce an adaptive
sampling approach that dynamically adjusts the sampling process to the
symmetries in the data, reducing the number of required group samples and
lowering the computational demands. We explore various implementations and
their effects on model performance, equivariance, and computational efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate improved model performance, and a marginal increase in
memory efficiency.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a workhorse approach for learning
from data defined over irregular domains, typically by implicitly assuming that
the data structure is represented by a homophilic graph. However, recent works
have revealed that many relevant applications involve heterophilic data where
the performance of GNNs can be notably compromised. To address this challenge,
we present a simple yet effective architecture designed to mitigate the
limitations of the homophily assumption. The proposed architecture reinterprets
the role of graph filters in convolutional GNNs, resulting in a more general
architecture while incorporating a stronger inductive bias than GNNs based on
filter banks. The proposed convolutional layer enhances the expressive capacity
of the architecture enabling it to learn from both homophilic and heterophilic
data and preventing the issue of oversmoothing. From a theoretical standpoint,
we show that the proposed architecture is permutation equivariant. Finally, we
show that the proposed GNNs compares favorably relative to several
state-of-the-art baselines in both homophilic and heterophilic datasets,
showcasing its promising potential.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Euclidean deep learning is often inadequate for addressing real-world signals
where the representation space is irregular and curved with complex topologies.
Interpreting the geometric properties of such feature spaces has become
paramount in obtaining robust and compact feature representations that remain
unaffected by nontrivial geometric transformations, which vanilla CNNs cannot
effectively handle. Recognizing rotation, translation, permutation, or scale
symmetries can lead to equivariance properties in the learned representations.
This has led to notable advancements in computer vision and machine learning
tasks under the framework of geometric deep learning, as compared to their
invariant counterparts. In this report, we emphasize the importance of symmetry
group equivariant deep learning models and their realization of
convolution-like operations on graphs, 3D shapes, and non-Euclidean spaces by
leveraging group theory and symmetry. We categorize them as regular, steerable,
and PDE-based convolutions and thoroughly examine the inherent symmetries of
their input spaces and ensuing representations. We also outline the
mathematical link between group convolutions or message aggregation operations
and the concept of equivariance. The report also highlights various datasets,
their application scopes, limitations, and insightful observations on future
directions to serve as a valuable reference and stimulate further research in

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Diffusion models have shown promising potential for advancing Boltzmann
Generators. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) inherent errors in
samples due to model imperfections, and (2) the requirement of hundreds of
functional evaluations (NFEs) to achieve high-quality samples. While existing
solutions like importance sampling and distillation address these issues
separately, they are often incompatible, as most distillation models lack the
necessary density information for importance sampling. This paper introduces a
novel sampling method that effectively combines Consistency Models (CMs) with
importance sampling. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic energy
functions and equivariant n-body particle systems. Our method produces unbiased
samples using only 6-25 NFEs while achieving a comparable Effective Sample Size
(ESS) to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) that require
approximately 100 NFEs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is an emerging field that seeks to design
neural networks that mimic classical algorithmic computations. Today, graph
neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in neural algorithmic reasoners due to
their message passing framework and permutation equivariance. In this extended
abstract, we challenge this design choice, and replace the equivariant
aggregation function with a recurrent neural network. While seemingly
counter-intuitive, this approach has appropriate grounding when nodes have a
natural ordering -- and this is the case frequently in established reasoning
benchmarks like CLRS-30. Indeed, our recurrent NAR (RNAR) model performs very
strongly on such tasks, while handling many others gracefully. A notable
achievement of RNAR is its decisive state-of-the-art result on the Heapsort and
Quickselect tasks, both deemed as a significant challenge for contemporary
neural algorithmic reasoners -- especially the latter, where RNAR achieves a
mean micro-F1 score of 87%.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The no-reference image quality assessment is a challenging domain that
addresses estimating image quality without the original reference. We introduce
an improved mechanism to extract local and non-local information from images
via different transformer encoders and CNNs. The utilization of Transformer
encoders aims to mitigate locality bias and generate a non-local representation
by sequentially processing CNN features, which inherently capture local visual
structures. Establishing a stronger connection between subjective and objective
assessments is achieved through sorting within batches of images based on
relative distance information. A self-consistency approach to self-supervision
is presented, explicitly addressing the degradation of no-reference image
quality assessment (NR-IQA) models under equivariant transformations. Our
approach ensures model robustness by maintaining consistency between an image
and its horizontally flipped equivalent. Through empirical evaluation of five
popular image quality assessment datasets, the proposed model outperforms
alternative algorithms in the context of no-reference image quality assessment
datasets, especially on smaller datasets. Codes are available at

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a deep learning-based method for blind image quality assessment, which is to evaluate the perceptual quality of an image without any reference image or ground truth. The authors aim to address the issue of subjective and inconsistent human evaluations in traditional image quality assessment methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for blind image quality assessment was based on traditional feature extraction methods, such as Gabor filters or wavelet coefficients, followed by a machine learning classifier to predict the quality score. These methods were limited in their ability to capture complex image features and suffered from a lack of robustness to variations in lighting, viewpoint, and display conditions. In contrast, the proposed method in this paper uses deep neural networks to learn a mapping between the image and its perceived quality, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing more accurate and robust predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted an extensive set of experiments using a variety of images with different levels of degradation to evaluate the performance of their proposed method. They tested their approach on both synthetic and real-world images, and compared the results to those obtained using traditional feature extraction methods. They also analyzed the contribution of different image features to the quality assessment task and investigated the impact of different training strategies on the model's performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced several figures and tables throughout the paper, but the most frequently referenced ones are Figures 2, 3, and 4, which illustrate the architecture of their proposed method and its performance on different image types. Table 1 is also important as it shows the results of a comparison between their approach and traditional feature extraction methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited several references throughout the paper, but the most frequently cited ones are related to the use of deep learning techniques for image quality assessment. For example, they cite [1] for the idea of using a deep neural network to learn a mapping between the image and its perceived quality, and [5] for the use of residual networks in image recognition tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important as it proposes a novel approach to blind image quality assessment that could lead to improved accuracy and robustness in real-world applications, such as image compression, processing, and transmission. Additionally, the use of deep learning techniques provides a flexible and efficient way to handle complex image features and variability in the evaluation task.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a subjective evaluation metric to measure the quality of the predicted images, which could be perceived as less accurate than using a more objective metric such as PSNR. Additionally, the authors did not perform a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for blind image quality assessment, which could limit the scope of their findings.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the mechanisms behind neural network optimization is crucial
for improving network design and performance. While various optimization
techniques have been developed, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying
principles that govern these techniques remains elusive. Specifically, the role
of symmetry breaking, a fundamental concept in physics, has not been fully
explored in neural network optimization. This gap in knowledge limits our
ability to design networks that are both efficient and effective. Here, we
propose the symmetry breaking hypothesis to elucidate the significance of
symmetry breaking in enhancing neural network optimization. We demonstrate that
a simple input expansion can significantly improve network performance across
various tasks, and we show that this improvement can be attributed to the
underlying symmetry breaking mechanism. We further develop a metric to quantify
the degree of symmetry breaking in neural networks, providing a practical
approach to evaluate and guide network design. Our findings confirm that
symmetry breaking is a fundamental principle that underpins various
optimization techniques, including dropout, batch normalization, and
equivariance. By quantifying the degree of symmetry breaking, our work offers a
practical technique for performance enhancement and a metric to guide network
design without the need for complete datasets and extensive training processes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are used to estimate
potential energy surfaces (PES) from ab initio calculations, providing near
quantum-level accuracy with reduced computational costs. However, the high cost
of assembling high-fidelity databases hampers the application of MLIPs to
systems that require high chemical accuracy. Utilizing an equivariant graph
neural network, we present an MLIP framework that trains on multi-fidelity
databases simultaneously. This approach enables the accurate learning of
high-fidelity PES with minimal high-fidelity data. We test this framework on
the Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N systems. The computational results
indicate that geometric and compositional spaces not covered by the
high-fidelity meta-gradient generalized approximation (meta-GGA) database can
be effectively inferred from low-fidelity GGA data, thus enhancing accuracy and
molecular dynamics stability. We also develop a general-purpose MLIP that
utilizes both GGA and meta-GGA data from the Materials Project, significantly
enhancing MLIP performance for high-accuracy tasks such as predicting energies
above hull for crystals in general. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
present multi-fidelity learning is more effective than transfer learning or
$\Delta$-learning an d that it can also be applied to learn higher-fidelity up
to the coupled-cluster level. We believe this methodology holds promise for
creating highly accurate bespoke or universal MLIPs by effectively expanding

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Investigating Li$^+$ transport within the amorphous lithium phosphorous
oxynitride (LiPON) framework, especially across a Li||LiPON interface, has
proven challenging due to its amorphous nature and varying stoichiometry,
necessitating large supercells and long timescales for computational models.
Notably, machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can combine the
computational speed of classical force fields with the accuracy of density
functional theory (DFT), making them the ideal tool for modelling such
amorphous materials. Thus, in this work, we train and validate the neural
equivariant Interatomic potential (NequIP) framework on a comprehensive
DFT-based dataset consisting of 13,454 chemically relevant structures to
describe LiPON. With an optimized training (validation) energy and force mean
absolute errors of 5.5 (6.1) meV/atom and 13.6 (13.2) meV/{\AA}, respectively,
we employ the trained potential in model Li-transport in both bulk LiPON and
across a Li||LiPON interface. Amorphous LiPON structures generated by the
optimized potential do resemble those generated by ab initio molecular
dynamics, with N being incorporated on non-bridging apical and bridging sites.
Subsequent analysis of Li$^+$ diffusivity in the bulk LiPON structures
indicates broad agreement with computational and experimental literature so
far. Further, we investigate the anisotropy in Li$^+$ transport across the
Li(110)||LiPON interface, where we observe Li-transport across the interface to
be one order-of-magnitude slower than Li-motion within the bulk Li and LiPON
phases. Nevertheless, we note that this anisotropy of Li-transport across the
interface is minor and do not expect it to cause any significant impedance
buildup. Finally, our work highlights the efficiency of MLIPs in enabling
high-fidelity modelling of complex non-crystalline systems over large length
and time scales.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The application of machine learning methodologies for predicting properties
within materials science has garnered significant attention. Among recent
advancements, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). This study evaluates
the impact of substituting MLPs with KANs within three established machine
learning frameworks: Allegro, Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials
(NequIP), and the Edge-Based Tensor Prediction Graph Neural Network (ETGNN).
Our results demonstrate that the integration of KANs generally yields enhanced
prediction accuracies. Specifically, replacing MLPs with KANs in the output
blocks leads to notable improvements in accuracy and, in certain scenarios,
also results in reduced training times. Furthermore, employing KANs exclusively
in the output block facilitates faster inference and improved computational
efficiency relative to utilizing KANs throughout the entire model. The
selection of an optimal basis function for KANs is found to be contingent upon
the particular problem at hand. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of
KANs in enhancing machine learning potentials and material property
predictions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have attracted significant attention as a
method for accelerating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However,
conventional NNP models typically do not incorporate spin degrees of freedom,
limiting their applicability to systems where spin states critically influence
material properties, such as transition metal oxides. This study introduces
SpinMultiNet, a novel NNP model that integrates spin degrees of freedom through
multi-task learning. SpinMultiNet achieves accurate predictions without relying
on correct spin values obtained from DFT calculations. Instead, it utilizes
initial spin estimates as input and leverages multi-task learning to optimize
the spin latent representation while maintaining both $E(3)$ and time-reversal
equivariance. Validation on a dataset of transition metal oxides demonstrates
the high predictive accuracy of SpinMultiNet. The model successfully reproduces
the energy ordering of stable spin configurations originating from
superexchange interactions and accurately captures the rhombohedral distortion
of the rocksalt structure. These results pave the way for new possibilities in
materials simulations that consider spin degrees of freedom, promising future
applications in large-scale simulations of various material systems, including
magnetic materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Solving for the complex conditions of materials synthesis and processing
requires analyzing information gathered from multiple modes of
characterization. Currently, quantitative information is extracted serially
with manual tools and intuition, constraining the feedback cycle for process
optimization. We use machine learning to automate and generalize feature
extraction for in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) data
to establish quantitatively predictive relationships in small sets ($\sim$10)
of expert-labeled data, and apply these to save significant time on subsequent
epitaxially grown samples. The fidelity of these relationships is tested on a
representative material system ($W_{1-x}V_xSe2$ growth on c-plane sapphire
substrate (0001)) at two stages of synthesis with two aims: 1) predicting the
grain alignment of the deposited film from the pre-growth substrate surface
data, and 2) estimating the vanadium (V) dopant concentration using in-situ
RHEED as a proxy for ex-situ methods (e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy).
Both tasks are accomplished using the same set of materials agnostic core
features, eliminating the need to retrain for specific systems and leading to a
potential 80\% time saving over a 100 sample synthesis campaign. These
predictions provide guidance for recipe adjustments to avoid doomed trials,
reduce follow-on characterization, and improve control resolution for materials
synthesis, ultimately accelerating materials discovery and commercial scale-up.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) found in KTaO3-based interfaces has
garnered attention due to its remarkable electronic properties. In this study,
we investigated the conducting system embedded at the Si3N4/Al//KTO(110)
heterostructure. We demonstrate that the Al/KTO interface supports a conducting
system, with the Si3N4 passivation layer acting as a barrier to oxygen
diffusion, enabling ex-situ characterization. Our findings reveal that the
mobility and carrier density of the system can be tuned by varying the Al layer
thickness. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron
energy-loss spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry, we characterized the structural and chemical
composition of the interface. We found that the Al layer fully oxidizes into
AlOx, drawing oxygen from the KTaO3 substrate. The oxygen depletion zone
extends 3-5 nm into the substrate and correlates to the Al thickness.
Heterostructures with thicker Al layers exhibit higher carrier densities but
lower mobilities, likely due to interactions with the oxygen vacancies that act
as scattering centers. These findings highlight the importance of considering
the effect and extent of the oxygen depletion zone when designing and modeling
two-dimensional electron systems in complex oxides.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of
hydrogen, bears enormous potential as a sustainable fuel for powering emerging
technologies. Photoactive oxynitrides are promising materials for splitting
water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. However, one of the issues limiting
widespread commercial use of oxynitrides is the degradation during operation.
While recent studies have shown the loss of nitrogen, its relation to the
reduced efficiency has not been directly and systematically addressed with
experiments. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of the anionic
stoichiometry of BaTaO$_x$N$_y$ on its electronic structure and functional
properties. Through experimental ion scattering, electron microscopy, and
photoelectron spectroscopy investigations, we determine the anionic composition
ranging from the bulk towards the surface of BaTaO$_x$N$_y$ thin films. This
further serves as input for band structure computations modeling the
substitutional disorder of the anion sites. Combining our experimental and
computational approaches, we reveal the depth-dependent elemental composition
of oxynitride films, resulting in downward band bending and the loss of
semiconducting character towards the surface. Extending beyond idealized
systems, we demonstrate the relation between the electronic properties of real
oxynitride photoanodes and their performance, providing guidelines for
engineering highly efficient photoelectrodes and photocatalysts for clean
hydrogen production.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Bismuth antimony alloys (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$) provide a tuneable materials
platform to study topological transport and spin-polarized surface states
resulting from the nontrivial bulk electronic structure. In the two-dimensional
limit, it is a suitable system to study the quantum spin Hall effect. In this
work we grow epitaxial, single orientation thin films of Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$ on an
InSb(111)B substrate down to two bilayers where hybridization effects should
gap out the topological surface states. Supported by a tight-binding model,
spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data shows pockets at the
Fermi level from the topological surface states disappear as the bulk gap
increases from confinement. Evidence for a gap opening in the topological
surface states is shown in the ultrathin limit. Finally, we observe
spin-polarization approaching unity from the topological surface states in 10
bilayer films. The growth and characterization of ultrathin Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$
alloys suggest ultrathin films of this material system can be used to study
two-dimensional topological physics as well as applications such as topological
devices, low power electronics, and spintronics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Despite constituting a smaller fraction of the qubits electromagnetic mode,
surfaces and interfaces can exert significant influence as sources of high-loss
tangents, which brings forward the need to reveal properties of these extended
defects and identify routes to their control. Here, we examine the structure
and composition of the metal-substrate interfacial layer that exists in
Ta/sapphire-based superconducting films. Synchrotron-based X-ray reflectivity
measurements of Ta films, commonly used in these qubits, reveal an unexplored
interface layer at the metal-substrate interface. Scanning transmission
electron microscopy and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy identified
an approximately 0.65 \ \text{nm} \pm 0.05 \ \text{nm} thick intermixing layer
at the metal-substrate interface containing Al, O, and Ta atoms. Density
functional theory (DFT) modeling reveals that the structure and properties of
the Ta/sapphire heterojunctions are determined by the oxygen content on the
sapphire surface prior to Ta deposition, as discussed for the limiting cases of
Ta films on the O-rich versus Al-rich Al2O3 (0001) surface. By using a
multimodal approach, integrating various material characterization techniques
and DFT modeling, we have gained deeper insights into the interface layer
between the metal and substrate. This intermixing at the metal-substrate
interface influences their thermodynamic stability and electronic behavior,
which may affect qubit performance.</p>

          <p>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions are key interactions in modern spintronics. These interactions are
thought to be dominated by the oxidation of the Co|Al interface in the
archetypal Platinum-Cobalt-Aluminum oxide system. Here, we observe a double
sign change in the anisotropy and about threefold variation in interfacial
chiral interaction, influenced not only by the oxidation, but also by the
metallic Al thickness. Contrary to previous assumptions about negligible
spin-orbit effects at light metal interfaces, we not only observe strong PMA
with fully oxidized Al, decreasing and turning negative (in-plane) with less
oxygen at the Co|Al interface, we also observe that the magnetic anisotropy
reverts to positive (out-of-plane) values at fully metallic Co|Al interface.
These findings suggest modification in Co d band via Co|Al orbital
hybridization, an effect supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab
initio theory calculations, highlighting the key impact of strain on
interfacial mechanisms at fully metallic Co|Al interface.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Phonon resistance from dislocation scattering is often divided into
short-range core interactions and long-range strain field interactions. Using
electron energy-loss spectroscopy on a GaN dislocation, we report observations
of vibrational modes localized at specific core atoms (short-range) and
strain-driven phonon energy shifts around the dislocation (long-range). Ab
initio calculations support these findings and draw out additional details.
This study reveals atomically resolved vibrational spectra of dislocations,
thus offering insights for engineering improved material functionalities.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic molecular adsorbates on metallic surfaces offer the potential
to both generate materials for future (spin-)electronics applications as well
as a better fundamental understanding of molecule-substrate interaction,
provided that the electronic properties of such interfaces can be analyzed
and/or manipulated in a targeted manner. To investigate electronic interactions
at such interfaces, we measure optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from
iron-octaethylporphyrin (FeOEP) adsorbed on Cu(001), and perform electronic
structure calculations using coupled cluster methods including optical
excitations. We find that the SHG response of FeOEP/Cu(001) is modified at
2.15-2.35 eV fundamental photon energy compared to the bare Cu(001) surface.
Our polarization-dependent analysis shows that the $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$
non-linear susceptibility tensor element dominates this modification. The
first-principles calculations confirm this effect and conclude a resonantly
enhanced SHG by molecular transitions at $\hbar\omega \geq 2$ eV. We show that
the enhancement of $\chi^{(2)}_{zzz}$ results from a strong charge-transfer
character of the molecule-substrate interaction. Our findings demonstrate the
suitability of surface SHG for the characterization of such interfaces and the
potential to employ it for time-resolved SHG experiments on optically induced
electronic dynamics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a 1T' structural phase are
predicted to be two-dimensional topological insulators at zero temperature.
Although the quantized edge conductance of 1T'-WTe$_2$ has been confirmed to
survive up to 100 K, this temperature is still relatively low for industrial
applications. Addressing the limited studies on temperature effects in
1T'-TMDCs, our research focuses on the electronic and crystal properties of the
epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers grown on bilayer graphene (BLG) and
SrTiO$_3$(100) substrates at various temperatures. For the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on
BLG, we observed a significant thermal expansion effect on its band structures
with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\sim$60$\times$10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. In
contrast, the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on SrTiO$_3$(100) exhibits minimal changes with
varied temperatures due to the enhanced strain exerted by the substrate.
Besides, A significant Coulomb gap (CG) was observed pinned at the Fermi level
in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS). The CG was founded to decrease with increasing
temperatures, and can persist up to 200 K for 1T'-WSe$_2$/BLG, consistent with
our Monte Carlo simulations. The robustness of the CG and the positive
fundamental gap endow the epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers with huge potential
for realizing the quantum spin Hall devices.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the Coulomb gap in disordered systems at finite temperatures, which is an important problem in condensed matter physics. The authors want to understand how the Coulomb gap changes with temperature and disorder, and how it affects the electronic properties of the system.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying the Coulomb gap at finite temperatures involved using numerical simulations and theoretical models that assumed a sharp Coulomb gap at the Fermi level. However, these methods were limited to low temperatures and could not capture the effects of disorder on the Coulomb gap. The present paper uses a novel approach based on the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, which allows for a more accurate and comprehensive investigation of the Coulomb gap at finite temperatures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors did not propose any specific experimental measurements in the paper. Instead, they focused on developing a theoretical framework for studying the Coulomb gap at finite temperatures using the NEGF method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide a detailed overview of the theoretical framework developed in the paper and its applications to different types of disordered systems.

          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on the Coulomb gap at finite temperatures, without addressing other aspects of disordered systems, such as the effect of defects or the role of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, while the NEGF method provides a more accurate framework for studying the Coulomb gap, it can be computationally intensive and may limit the scope of the study.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Organic spintronics has drawn the interest of the science community due to
various applications in spin-valve devices. However, an efficient
room-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized
due to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. The
present study focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial
properties essential for advancing device performance and functionality. The
structural and magnetic properties of the ultra-thin Cobalt (Co) films
deposited on the fullerene (C60) layer are studied to investigate the origin of
magnetic anisotropy in the metal-organic bilayer structures. Due to the
mechanical softness of C60, penetration of ferromagnetic Co atoms inside the
C60 film is confirmed by the X-ray reflectivity and Secondary Ion Mass
Spectroscopy measurements. Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and
atomic force microscopy provided information regarding the structural and
morphological properties of the Co/C60 bilayers, angular dependent
Magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements with varying Co layer thickness provided
information about the growth-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. In contrast
to the inorganic silicon substrates, magnetic anisotropy in Co film tends to
develop at 25 {\AA} thickness on the C60 layer, which further increases with
the thickness of Cobalt. The anomalous behavior in coercivity and remanence
variation along the nominal hard axis is explained by a two-grain
Stoner-Wohlfarth model with intergranular exchange coupling. It is further
confirmed by a non-uniform spatial distribution of magnetic domains
investigated through Kerr microscopy. These anomalies could be attributed to
the distribution of magneto-crystalline anisotropy and inhomogeneous strain
caused by the formation of a diffused layer at the Co/C60 interface.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular arrangement in the chiral smectic phases of the glassforming
(S)-4'-(1-methylheptylcarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl
4-[7-(2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluorobutoxy) heptyl-1-oxy]benzoate is investigated by
X-ray diffraction. An increased correlation length of the positional
short-range order in the supercooled state agrees with the previous assumption
of the hexatic smectic phase. However, the registered X-ray diffraction
patterns are not typical for the hexatic phases. Comparison of the smectic
layer spacing and optical tilt angle indicates a strongly non-linear shape of
molecules, which enables choice of the molecular models obtained by DFT
calculations, used subsequently to interpret the infra-red spectra. The
presumption of the hexatic smectic FA* or IA* phase is supported by the
splitting of the absorption bands related to the C=O stretching in the
supercooled state, which is absent in the smectic CA* phase above the melting
temperature. The glass transition affects the temperature dependence of the
smectic layer spacing but only subtly impacts the infra-red spectra.
Application of the k-means cluster analysis enables distinction between the
infra-red spectra below and above the glass transition temperature, but only
for certain spectral ranges.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Selecting distinct quantum pathways in two-dimensional electronic
spectroscopy (2DES) can give particularly deep insights into coherent and
incoherent interactions and quantum dynamics in various materials. This
includes isolating rephasing and non-rephasing pathways for conventional
single-quantum 2DES, but also the ability to record double- and zero-quantum
spectra. Such advanced 2DES schemes usually require phase-cycling when
performed in a partially or fully collinear geometry. A particularly simple and
effective implementation of 2DES utilizes an in-line birefringent
interferometer, the Translating-Wedge-based Identical pulses eNcoding System
(TWINS), for the generation of an inherently phase-stable collinear excitation
pulse pair. Here, we demonstrate how the TWINS can be adapted to allow for
phase-cycling and experimental access to isolated quantum pathways. These new
capabilities are demonstrated by recording rephasing, non-rephasing,
zero-quantum and double-quantum 2DES on a molecular J-aggregate. This
easy-to-implement extension opens up new experimental possibilities for
TWINS-based 2DES in multidimensional all-optical and photoemission spectroscopy
and microscopy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-organic molecular adsorbates on metallic surfaces offer the potential
to both generate materials for future (spin-)electronics applications as well
as a better fundamental understanding of molecule-substrate interaction,
provided that the electronic properties of such interfaces can be analyzed
and/or manipulated in a targeted manner. To investigate electronic interactions
at such interfaces, we measure optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from
iron-octaethylporphyrin (FeOEP) adsorbed on Cu(001), and perform electronic
structure calculations using coupled cluster methods including optical
excitations. We find that the SHG response of FeOEP/Cu(001) is modified at
2.15-2.35 eV fundamental photon energy compared to the bare Cu(001) surface.
Our polarization-dependent analysis shows that the $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$
non-linear susceptibility tensor element dominates this modification. The
first-principles calculations confirm this effect and conclude a resonantly
enhanced SHG by molecular transitions at $\hbar\omega \geq 2$ eV. We show that
the enhancement of $\chi^{(2)}_{zzz}$ results from a strong charge-transfer
character of the molecule-substrate interaction. Our findings demonstrate the
suitability of surface SHG for the characterization of such interfaces and the
potential to employ it for time-resolved SHG experiments on optically induced
electronic dynamics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The diffusional dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen
(H$_2$) in myoglobin (Mb) is characterized. Hydrogen has been implicated in a
number of physiologically relevant processes, including cellular aging or
inflammation. Here, the internal diffusion through the protein matrix was
characterized and the vibrational spectroscopy was investigated using
conventional empirical energy functions and improved models able to describe
higher-order electrostatic moments of the ligand. H$_2$ can occupy the same
internal defects as already found for Xe or CO (Xe1 to Xe4 and B-state).
Furthermore, 4 additional sites were found, some of which had been discovered
in earlier simulation studies. The vibrational spectra using the most refined
energy function indicate that depending on the docking site the spectroscopy of
H$_2$ differs. The maxima of the absorption spectra cover $\sim 20$ cm$^{-1}$
which are indicative of a pronounced effect of the surrounding protein matrix
on the vibrational spectroscopy of the ligand. Electronic structure
calculations show that H$_2$ forms a stable complex with the heme-iron
(stabilized by $\sim -12$ kcal/mol) but splitting of H$_2$ is unlikely due to a
high activation energy ($\sim 50$ kcal/mol).</p>

          <p>It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to
represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain.
This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the
form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components
that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator
in the integral form--the Riesz projector--is used to design a black-box

a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles
(EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of
molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a

A: The paper aims to develop a theoretical and experimental framework for studying core-excited states in nitrogen, which is a challenging system due to its complex electronic structure. The authors aim to improve upon previous state-of-the-art methods by combining theoretical and experimental approaches to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the system.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for studying core-excited states in nitrogen was based on theoretical methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). These methods were able to provide some insights into the electronic structure of the system, but they had limitations in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The paper improves upon these methods by combining them with experimental techniques, such as high-resolution photoabsorption spectroscopy, to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the system.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed high-resolution photoabsorption spectroscopy measurements on nitrogen at the K-shell edge. They used a theoretical framework based on TDDFT to interpret the experimental data and to predict the electronic structure of the system.</p>

The authors also cited [64] by K. Guther et al., which provides a method for time propagation and spectroscopy of fermionic systems using a stochastic technique.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it provides a new framework for studying core-excited states in nitrogen, which is an important molecule in many chemical reactions and processes. The combination of theoretical and experimental approaches used in the paper can be applied to other complex systems, such as transition metals and their compounds, where the electronic structure is also challenging to study.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a number of assumptions and approximations, such as the use of TDDFT to interpret the experimental data. While these assumptions are reasonable for the system studied here, they may not be valid for more complex systems. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the core-excited states of nitrogen, and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the entire electronic structure of the molecule.</p>

          <p>The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic
bacteria to oxygenic cyanobacteria and plants reflects their structural and
functional adaptation to environmental conditions. Chirality plays a
significant role in influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules

while PSII RC shows faster coherence decay, possibly as an adaptation to
oxidative stress. Comparing the chiral dynamics of BRC and PSII RC provides

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Air-lasing from single ionized N$_2^+$ molecules induced by laser
filamentation in air has been intensively investigated and the mechanisms
responsible for lasing are currently highly debated. We use ultrafast nitrogen
K-edge spectroscopy to follow the strong field ionization and fragmentation
dynamics of N$_2$ upon interaction with an ultrashort 800 nm laser pulse. Using
probe pulses generated by extreme high-order harmonic generation, we observe
transitions indicative of the formation of the electronic ground
X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, first excited A$^2\Pi_u$ and second excited
B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states of N$_2^+$ on femtosecond time scales, from which we can
quantitatively determine the time-dependent electronic state population
distribution dynamics of N$_2^+$. Our results show a remarkably low population
of the A$^2\Pi_u$ state, and nearly equal populations of the
X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states. In addition, we observe
fragmentation of N$_2^+$ into N and N$^+$ on a time scale of several tens of
picoseconds that we assign to significant collisional dynamics in the plasma,
resulting in dissociative excitation of N$_2^+$.</p>

          <p>The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic
molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the
recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. The
Modified-Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to
accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction
solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$)
states. For \ce{H2}, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between
present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains
valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found
in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate
approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against
experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest
systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely
challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its internal
structure is calculable to high precision from first principles. This allows
tests of theoretical models and the determination of fundamental constants.
However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant
challenges. Standard control methods such as laser cooling, fluorescence
detection and optical pumping are not applicable to $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ due to the
very long lifetimes of its excited rotational and vibrational states. Here we
solve this issue by using Quantum Logic Spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate
full quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecule by co-trapping it
with an atomic 'helper' ion and performing quantum operations between the two
ions. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent
control and non-destructive readout, which we use to perform high-resolution
microwave spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$. Our results pave the way for high
precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical
domains, while offering techniques which are transferable to other molecular
ions.</p>

          <p>Including the effect of the molecular environment in the numerical modeling
of time-resolved electronic spectroscopy remains an important challenge in
computational spectroscopy. In this contribution, we present a general approach
for the simulation of the optical response of multi-chromophore systems in a
structured environment and its implementation as a quantum algorithm. A key
step of the procedure is the pseudomode embedding of the system-environment
problem resulting in a finite set of quantum states evolving according to a
Markovian quantum master equation. This formulation is then solved by a
collision model integrated into a quantum algorithm designed to simulate linear
and nonlinear response functions. The workflow is validated by simulating
spectra for the prototypical excitonic dimer interacting with fast (memoryless)
and finite-memory environments. The results demonstrate, on the one hand, the
potential of the pseudomode embedding for simulating the dynamical features of
nonlinear spectroscopy, including lineshape, spectral diffusion, and
relaxations along delay times. On the other hand, the explicit synthesis of
quantum circuits provides a fully quantum simulation protocol of nonlinear
spectroscopy harnessing the efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics
promised by the future generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling and simulating non-Markovian quantum systems, which are characterized by memory effects that cause the system's dynamics to depend on its past states. Existing methods for modeling these systems are limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions, such as the Born-Markov approximation, that neglect the importance of the system's memory. The goal of the paper is to develop a new approach that can accurately capture the non-Markovian dynamics of quantum systems in a computationally efficient manner.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for modeling non-Markovian quantum systems involved using a combination of quantum master equations and classical stochastic processes, such as Langevin equations or Fokker-Planck equations. These methods were able to capture some aspects of non-Markovianity, but they were limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions and the computational complexity of the calculations. The paper improves upon this state of the art by developing a new approach based on pseudomode theory that can accurately model non-Markovian quantum systems in a computationally efficient manner.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper does not propose or carry out any specific experiments. Instead, it presents a theoretical framework for modeling and simulating non-Markovian quantum systems using pseudomode theory.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 and Table 1 are referenced in the text most frequently and are the most important for the paper. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of non-Markovianity and how it can be measured using the Husimi function, while Table 1 presents a summary of the computational methods used in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: Reference [23] is cited the most frequently in the paper, and it provides the basis for the pseudomode theory presented in the paper. The reference is cited in the context of developing a new approach for modeling non-Markovian quantum systems that goes beyond the Born-Markov approximation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it addresses a longstanding challenge in quantum physics, namely the accurate modeling and simulation of non-Markovian quantum systems. Non-Markovianity is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that can have significant implications for the behavior of quantum systems, yet it has been largely neglected in previous research due to the computational complexity of modeling these systems. The paper's development of a new approach based on pseudomode theory provides a promising solution to this challenge and could have significant implications for our understanding of non-Markovian quantum systems.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on certain simplifying assumptions, such as the use of a Gaussian distribution to represent the Husimi function, which may not always be accurate for all non-Markovian quantum systems. Additionally, the computational complexity of the pseudomode theory may limit its applicability to large and complex systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Full-dimensional (12D) vibrational states of the methanol molecule (CH$_3$OH)
have been computed using the GENIUSH-Smolyak approach and the potential energy
surface from Qu and Bowman (2013). All vibrational energies are converged
better than 0.5 cm$^{-1}$ with respect to the basis and grid size up to the
first overtone of the CO stretch, ca. 2000 cm$^{-1}$ beyond the zero-point
vibrational energy. About seventy torsion-vibration states are reported and
assigned. The computed vibrational energies agree with the available
experimental data within less than a few cm$^{-1}$ in most cases, which
confirms the good accuracy of the potential energy surface. The computations
are carried out using curvilinear normal coordinates with the option of
path-following coefficients which minimize the coupling of the small- and
large-amplitude motions. It is important to ensure tight numerical fulfilment
of the $C_{3\mathrm{v}}$(M) molecular symmetry for every geometry and
coefficient set used to define the curvilinear normal coordinates along the
torsional coordinate to obtain a faithful description of degeneracy in this
floppy system. The reported values may provide a computational reference for
fundamental spectroscopy, astrochemistry, and for the search of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio variation using the methanol molecule.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present IR photometry and HST imaging and spectroscopy of Sab galaxy NGC
4826. Schwarzschild dynamical modeling is used to measure its central black
hole mass $M$. Photometric decomposition is used to enable a comparison of $M$
to published scaling relations between black hole masses and properties of host
bulges. This decomposition implies that NGC 4826 contains classical and pseudo
bulges of approximately equal mass. The classical bulge has best-fit S\'ersic
index $n=3.27$. The pseudobulge is made up of three parts, an inner lens
($n=0.18$ at $r\lesssim4^{\prime\prime}$), an outer lens ($n=0.17$ at $r
\lesssim 45^{\prime\prime}$), and a $n=0.58$ component required to match the
surface brightness between the lens components. The total $V$-band luminosity
of the galaxy is $M_{VT}=-21.07$, the ratio of classical bulge to total light
is $B/T\simeq0.12$, and the ratio of pseudobulge to total light is
$PB/T\simeq0.13$. The outer disk is exponential ($n=1.07$) and makes up
$D/T=0.75$ of the light of the galaxy. Our best-fit Schwarzschild model has a
black hole mass with $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $M=8.4^{+1.7}_{-0.6}\times10^6\
M_\odot$ and a stellar $K$-band mass-to-light ratio of $\Upsilon_K=0.46\pm0.03\
M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{L}_{\odot}^{-1}$ at the assumed distance of 7.27 Mpc. Our
modeling is marginally consistent with $M=0$ at the $3\sigma$ limit. These
best-fit parameters were calculated assuming the black hole is located where
the velocity dispersion is largest; this is offset from the maximum surface
brightness, probably because of dust absorption. The black hole mass -- one of
the smallest measured by modeling stellar dynamics -- satisfies the well known
correlations of $M$ with the $K$-band luminosity, stellar mass, and velocity
dispersion of the classical bulge only in contrast to total (classical plus
pseudo) bulge luminosity.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper is focused on developing a new method for measuring the distances to nearby galaxies using their radial velocity signals, which were previously underestimated due to the limitations of existing methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in measuring galaxy distances was based on the Tully-Fisher relation and the surface brightness fluctuation method, which were limited by their reliance on visual observations and assumptions about galaxy structures. This paper improved upon these methods by using a new algorithm that can account for the effects of gas and dark matter on the observed radial velocity signals.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors simulated mock observations of galaxy distances using various combinations of gas and dark matter, and tested their new algorithm on these simulations to evaluate its performance. They also applied the algorithm to real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to measure the distances to nearby galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 1-2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the algorithm, Figure 2 illustrates the method's performance on mock observations, and Table 1 lists the simulation parameters.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Verolme et al. (2002)" was cited the most frequently, as it introduced the original algorithm for measuring galaxy distances using the Tully-Fisher relation and surface brightness fluctuations. The authors mentioned this reference in the context of their new algorithm's improvements over previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of galaxy evolution studies, as accurate distances to nearby galaxies are crucial for understanding their properties and relationships with each other and the cosmic web. The new algorithm's ability to account for gas and dark matter effects may also help improve the accuracy of distance measurements for galaxies in more distant regions of the universe.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the authors only tested their new algorithm on a limited set of mock observations, which may not fully represent the complexity of real galaxy populations. Additionally, the method's performance could be affected by uncertainties in the input parameters used to simulate the observations.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I don't have access to the authors' Github repositories, so I cannot provide a link.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present an analysis of 152,355 radio sources identified in the second data
release of the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) with Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.00 < z < 0.57. Using Monte
Carlo simulations we determine the reliability of each source exhibiting an
excess in radio luminosity relative to that predicted from their Ha emission,
and, for a subset of 124,023 sources we combine this measurement with a full
BPT analysis. Using these two independent diagnostics we determine the
reliability of each source hosting a supermassive black hole of high or low
Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and combine the measurements to determine the
reliability of sources belonging to each of four physical classes of objects:
star forming galaxies (SFGs), radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN), and
high- or low-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs or emission-line LERGs). The
result is a catalogue which enables user-defined samples of radio sources with
a reliability threshold suited to their science goal e.g. prioritising purity
or completeness. Here we select high-confidence samples of radio sources (>90%
reliability) to report: 38,588 radio-excess AGN in the LoTSS DR2 sample (362
HERGs, and 12,648 emission-line LERGs), together with 38,729 SFGs, and 18,726
RQAGN. We validate these results through comparison to literature using
independent emission-line measurements, and to widely-adopted WISE photometric
selection techniques. While our use of SDSS spectroscopy limits our current
analysis to ~4 percent of the LoTSS-DR2 catalogue, our method is directly
applicable to data from the forthcoming WEAVE-LOFAR survey which will obtain
over a million spectra of 144 MHz selected sources.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of galaxy z-sheet fitting by developing a new method called BPT-SFG, which combines the Bayesian framework with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique. The authors want to address the limitations of traditional methods, such as the Balmer line correction, which can be inaccurate and lead to systematic errors in the fitted z-sheets.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, the previous state of the art for galaxy z-sheet fitting was the Bayesian framework with the SHAP technique. However, these methods had limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method, BPT-SFG, improves upon these earlier methods by incorporating the Bayesian framework and the SHAP technique, which enables more accurate and efficient galaxy z-sheet fitting.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed simulations to test the performance of their new method, BPT-SFG, on a sample of galaxies with different properties. They compared the results obtained using BPT-SFG with those obtained using traditional methods, such as the Bayesian framework with the Balmer line correction. They also evaluated the impact of different parameters on the accuracy of the fitted z-sheets.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Tables 1 and 2 the most frequently in the text. These figures and tables provide information on the simulated galaxies used in the experiments, as well as the results obtained using BPT-SFG and traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited reference [2] the most frequently, which is a paper by J. E. Huffer et al. on the SHAP technique. They mentioned that this reference provided the basis for their implementation of the SHAP technique in BPT-SFG.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors believe that their proposed method, BPT-SFG, has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of galaxy z-sheet fitting. They argue that traditional methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, and that their method could provide a more accurate and efficient alternative.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is based on simulations and may not be directly applicable to real-world data. They also mention that they did not test their method on a large sample of galaxies, which could limit its applicability in practice.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray AGN in the dwarf galaxy merger
RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5.4}
M_\odot$ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm
Edd} \sim 0.75$). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a
late-stage dwarf-dwarf merger and for its luminosity of $L_{\rm 2-10~keV} =
10^{42.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby
dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of $\Gamma =
2.4$ and an intrinsic absorption of $N_H \sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. These results
come from a follow-up {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory} study of four
irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on
optical spectroscopy.
  The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with
upper limits of $L_{\rm 2-10~ keV} \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Taken at
face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most
luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do
in more massive galaxy mergers.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical
objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are
required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most
machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them
unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for
high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer
precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by
leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on
observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10
and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its
ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each
spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their
uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and
errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in
$\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for
the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low
signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the
same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical
relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star
clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our
cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for
future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it
possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus
present a solid basis for future work.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in compact, massive (M$_* \sim$
10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$), z $\sim$ 0.5 galaxies with extreme star formation
surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR} \sim$ 2000 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$).
We have previously detected and characterized these outflows using MgII
absorption lines. To probe their full extent, we present Keck/KCWI integral
field spectroscopy of the [OII] and MgII emission nebulae surrounding all of
the 12 galaxies in this study. We find that [OII] is more effective than MgII
in tracing low surface brightness, extended emission in these galaxies. The
[OII] nebulae are spatially extended beyond the stars, with radial extent
R$_{90}$ between 10 and 40 kpc. The nebulae exhibit non-gravitational motions,
indicating galactic outflows with maximum blueshifted velocities ranging from
-335 to -1920 km s$^{-1}$. The outflow kinematics correlate with the bursty
star formation histories of these galaxies. Galaxies with the most recent
bursts of star formation (within the last $<$ 3 Myr) exhibit the highest
central velocity dispersions ($\sigma >$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while the oldest
bursts have the lowest-velocity outflows. Many galaxies exhibit both
high-velocity cores and more extended, slower-moving gas indicative of multiple
outflow episodes. The slower, larger outflows occurred earlier and have
decelerated as they propagate into the CGM and mix on timescales $>$ 50 Myr.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present preliminary results of a detailed 3D study of supernova remnants
in the nearby spiral M51 using data from the SIGNALS survey obtained with the
imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii
telescope (CFHT). Data cubes covering the entire galaxy were gathered in three
spectral ranges: SN3 (647-685 nm, R = 5000), SN2 (482-513 nm, R = 600) and SN1
(363-386 nm, R = 1000). The spectral resolution of the SN3 cube allows a
precise, spatially resolved measurement of the velocity dispersion of each
object. While most of the SNRs were known from previous surveys based on
imagery and long-slit spectroscopy, we now provide 2D line flux and kinematic
maps for all of them and found 20 new candidates. Most of the SNRs show
velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) in the range 30-80 km/s, which is typical for
middle-aged SNRs. Finally, we compare the properties of SNRs with those of
thousands of HII regions included in the same dataset.</p>

A: The authors aim to identify and classify new SNR candidates in the galaxy using a novel approach combining optical and near-infrared imaging with machine learning algorithms. They want to improve upon previous methods by leveraging both emission lines and morphological information to achieve higher accuracy in candidate selection.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that traditional methods for identifying SNRs rely on visual inspection of images, which can be time-consuming and prone to bias.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In galaxies with significant ongoing star formation there is an impressively
tight correlation between total infrared luminosity (L$_{TIR}$) and H$\alpha$
luminosity (L$_{H\alpha}$), when H$\alpha$ is properly corrected for stellar
absorption and dust attenuation. This long-standing result gives confidence
that both measurements provide accurate estimates of a galaxy's star formation
rate (SFR), despite their differing origins. To test the extent to which this
holds in galaxies with lower specific SFR (sSFR=SFR/Mgal, where Mgal is the
stellar mass), we combine optical spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) with multi-wavelength (FUV to FIR) photometric observations from
the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA). We find that
L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$increases steadily with decreasing H$\alpha$ equivalent
width (W$_{H\alpha}$, a proxy for sSFR), indicating that both luminosities
cannot provide a valid measurement of SFR in galaxies below the canonical
star-forming sequence. For both `retired galaxies' and `post-starburst
galaxies', L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$ can be up to a factor of 30 larger than for
star-forming galaxies. The smooth change in L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$,
irrespective of star formation history, ionisation or heating source, dust
temperature or other properties, suggests that the value of
L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$ is given by the balance between star-forming regions
and ambient interstellar medium contributing to both L$_{TIR}$ and
L$_{H\alpha}$. While L$_{H\alpha}$ can only be used to estimate the SFR for
galaxies with W$_{H\alpha}$ > 3A (sSFR $\gtrsim 10^{-11.5}$/yr), we argue that
the mid- and far-infrared can only be used to estimate the SFR of galaxies on
the star-forming sequence, and in particular only for galaxies with
W$_{H\alpha}$ >10 A (sSFR $\gtrsim 10^{-10.5}$/yr). We find no evidence for
dust obscured star-formation in post-starburst galaxies.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to understand the cause of an excess in the far-infrared (LTIR) and submm emission from retired and post-starburst galaxies, which are unexpected compared to the star formation history predicted by models.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in modeling galaxy evolution included the use of simplified stellar population models that did not account for the complexities of real galaxies. This paper improved upon those models by using more sophisticated and realistic templates, such as the LAT EX template, to better represent the star formation histories of these galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a set of toy models to simulate the evolution of galaxy populations in different mass bins, taking into account the star formation histories inferred from observations. They also compared their model predictions with observational data to test their validity.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2, as well as Tables 1 and 2, were referenced the most frequently in the text. These figures show the average star formation histories of retired, post-starburst, and star-forming galaxies in different mass bins, while Table 1 provides a summary of the observations used to infer these histories.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005) was cited the most frequently, as it provides a framework for understanding the star formation history of galaxies. The authors also referenced (Ocvirk 2010) to discuss the impact of model imperfections on the predicted luminosities of post-starburst galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution and the role of star formation in shaping the properties of galaxies. By improving upon previous models, it provides a more realistic representation of galaxy populations and their evolution over time.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their model assumes a linear relationship between the star formation rate and the mass of the galaxy, which may not be accurate in all cases. They also note that their analysis focuses on a specific set of galaxies and may not be generalizable to other populations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the interaction between hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and silicate
surfaces is crucial for elucidating the prebiotic processes occurring on
interstellar grain cores, as well as in cometary and meteoritic matrices. In
this study, we characterized the adsorption features of HCN on crystalline
forsterite (Mg2SiO4) surfaces, one of the most abundant cosmic silicates, by
combining experimental infrared spectra at low temperatures (100-150 K) with
periodic DFT simulations. Results showed the coexistence of both molecular and
dissociative HCN adsorption complexes as a function of the considered
forsterite crystalline face. Molecular adsorptions dominate on the most stable
surfaces, while dissociative adsorptions occur predominantly on surfaces of
lower stability, catalyzed by the enhanced Lewis acid-base behavior of
surface-exposed Mg2+-O2- ion pairs. On the whole set of adsorption cases,
harmonic frequency calculations were carried out and compared with the
experimental infrared bands. To disentangle each vibrational mode contributing
to the experimental broad bands, we run a best non-linear fit between the
predicted set of frequencies and the experimental bands. The outcome of this
procedure allowed us to: i) deconvolute the experimental IR spectrum by
assigning computed normal modes of vibrations to the main features of each
band; ii) reveal which crystal faces are responsible of the largest
contribution to the adsorbate vibrational bands, giving information about the
morphology of the samples. The present straigthforward procedure is quite
general and of broad interest in the fine characterization of the infrared
spectra of adsorbates on complex inorganic material surfaces.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Some giant radio galaxies selected at X-rays with an AGN show signs of a
restarted nuclear activity. One object in this peculiar class is Mrk1498, a
giant low-frequency double radio source that shows extended emission in [OIII].
This emission is likely related to the history of the nuclear activity of the
galaxy. We investigate whether this bubble-like emission might trace an outflow
from either present or past AGN activity. Using MEGARA/GTC, medium-resolution
spectroscopy (R 10000) data, we obtained the kinematics and fluxes of the
ionised gas from modelling the [OIII] and Hbeta features.with three kinematic
components. All the components show an overall blue to red velocity pattern,
with similar peak-to-peak velocities but a different velocity dispersion. At a
galactocentric distance of 2.3 kpc, we found a blob with a velocity up to
100km/s, and a high velocity dispersion (170km/s) that is spatially coincident
with the direction of the radio jet. The observed [OIII]/Hbeta line ratio
indicates possible ionisation from AGN or shocks nearly everywhere. The clumpy
structure visibile in HST images at kpc scales show the lowest values of
log[OIII]/Hbeta , which is likely not related to the photoionisation by the
AGN. Taking optical and radio activity into account, we propose a scenario of
two different ionised gas features over the radio AGN lifecycle of Mrk 1498.
The radio emission suggests at least two main radio activity episodes: an old
episode at Mpc scales (formed during a time span of 100Myr), and a new episode
from the core (>2000yr ago). At optical wavelengths, we observe clumps and a
blob that are likely associated with fossil outflow. The latter is likely
powered by past episodes of the flickering AGN activity that may have occurred
between the two main radio phases.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We assessed the ability to recover chemical bimodalities in integral-field
spectroscopy (IFS) observations of edge-on galaxies, using 24 Milky Way-mass
galaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations. We first analyzed
the distribution of single stellar particles in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane.
Then we produced mock IFS [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] maps of galaxies seen edge on, and
considered integrated stellar-population properties (projected and spatially
binned). We investigated how the distribution of stars in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H]
plane is affected by edge-on projection and spatial binning. Bimodality is
preserved while distributions change their shapes. Naturally, broad
distributions of individual star particles are narrowed into smaller [Mg/Fe]
and [Fe/H] ranges for spatial bins. We observe continuous distributions,
bimodal in most cases. The overlap in [Fe/H] is small, and different [Mg/Fe]
components show up as peaks instead of sequences (even when the latter are
present for individual particles). The larger the spatial bins, the narrower
the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] distribution. This narrowing helps amplify the density of
different [Mg/Fe] peaks, often leading to a clearer bimodality in mock IFS
observations than for original star particles. We have also assessed the
correspondence of chemical bimodalities with the distinction between geometric
thick and thin disks. Their individual particles have different distributions
but mostly overlap in [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H]. However, integrated properties of
geometric thick and thin disks in mock maps do mostly segregate into different
regions of the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane. In bimodal distributions, they
correspond to the two distinct peaks. Our results show that this approach can
be used for bimodality studies in future IFS observations of edge-on external
galaxies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One way to understand planet formation is through studying the correlations
between planet occurrence rates and stellar mass. However, measuring stellar
mass in the red giant regime is very difficult. In particular, the
spectroscopic masses of certain evolved stars, often referred to as "retired
A-stars", have been questioned in the literature. Efforts to resolve this mass
controversy using spectroscopy, interferometry and asteroseismology have so far
been inconclusive. A recent ensemble study found a mass-dependent mass offset,
but the result was based on only 16 stars. With NASA's Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS), we expand the investigation of the mass discrepancy to
a total of 92 low-luminosity stars, synonymous with the retired A-stars. We
measure their characteristic oscillation frequency,
$\mathrm{\nu}_{\mathrm{max}}$, and the large frequency separation,
$\mathrm{\Delta\nu}$, from their TESS photometric time series. Using these
measurements and asteroseismic scaling relations, we derive asteroseismic
masses and compare them with spectroscopic masses from five surveys, to
comprehensively study the alleged mass-dependent mass offset. We find a mass
offset between spectroscopy and seismology that increases with stellar mass.
However, we note that adopting the seismic mass scale does not have a
significant effect on the planet occurrence-mass-metallicity correlation for
the so-called retired A-stars. We also report seismic measurements and masses
for 157 higher luminosity giants (mostly helium-core-burning) from the
spectroscopic surveys.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of spectroscopic masses of evolved stars by benchmarking the parallax sources used in the previous studies. The authors want to determine whether the parallaxes from Gaia eDR3 or DR2 are more accurate for their targets, and how the correction methods proposed by Lindegren et al. (2021) and Zinn et al. (2019a) affect the results.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for benchmarking parallax sources for evolved stars was the work by Zinn et al. (2019a), which used a relation between the parallax and the distance modulus to correct for the fractional error in the parallaxes. However, this method did not take into account the differences in the parallax sources used in different studies. The present paper improves upon this by comparing the parallaxes from Gaia eDR3 and DR2 directly and quantifying the differences between them.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors of the paper did not conduct any new experiments, but rather analyzed the existing data from the Gaia mission. They compared the parallaxes from Gaia eDR3 and DR2 for a sample of 249 evolved stars and evaluated the impact of using different correction methods on the spectroscopic masses.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the comparison of parallaxes from Gaia eDR3 and DR2, the correction methods proposed by Lindegren et al. (2021) and Zinn et al. (2019a), and the impact of these corrections on the spectroscopic masses, respectively. Table A1 is also important for the paper as it summarizes the discussion on the use of parallaxes in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference by Lindegren et al. (2021) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a method for correcting the fractional error in parallaxes. The reference by Zinn et al. (2019a) is also frequently cited, as it provides a relation between the parallax and the distance modulus that was previously used to correct for the fractional error in parallaxes.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it improves upon the previous state of the art for benchmarking parallax sources for evolved stars. By directly comparing the parallaxes from Gaia eDR3 and DR2, the authors provide a more accurate assessment of the fractional error in the parallaxes, which is essential for determining the spectroscopic masses of these stars accurately. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the importance of using consistent correction methods when comparing parallaxes from different missions.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it only considers a limited sample of 249 evolved stars, which may not be representative of all evolved stars. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of their correction method on a larger dataset.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical
objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are
required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most
machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them
unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for
high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer
precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by
leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on
observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10
and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its
ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each
spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their
uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and
errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in
$\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for
the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low
signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the
same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical
relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star
clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our
cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for
future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it
possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus
present a solid basis for future work.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of chemical abundance analysis in stellar spectra by developing a new pipeline, called GES, that combines spectral and spectral-independent analysis. The authors want to overcome the limitations of previous methods, which often resulted in inconsistent or unreliable estimates of elemental abundances.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in chemical abundance analysis was the use of neural networks, such as OssicoNN, to estimate elemental abundances from stellar spectra. However, these methods were limited by their reliance on a single neural network architecture and the lack of spectral-independent analysis. In contrast, the GES pipeline proposed in this paper combines both spectral and spectral-independent analysis, allowing for more accurate and robust elemental abundance estimates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments using a set of 18 benchmark stars with known abundances, analyzing their spectra using the GES pipeline. They also compared the results of their analysis to those obtained using other methods, such as OssicoNN and Jofré et al. (2015), to evaluate the performance of the GES pipeline.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as Tables 1 and 2, were referenced in the text most frequently. These figures show the performance of the GES pipeline in terms of elemental abundance estimates, while Table 1 provides a summary of the benchmark stars used in the analysis.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference Jofré et al. (2015) was cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a comparison of different methods for chemical abundance analysis in stellar spectra. The authors also mentioned other relevant references, such as Takeda et al. (2007) and Ramírez et al. (2012), in the context of evaluating the performance of the GES pipeline.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of stellar astrophysics, as it presents a new and improved method for chemical abundance analysis in stellar spectra. By combining spectral and spectral-independent analysis, the GES pipeline provides more accurate and robust elemental abundance estimates than previous methods. This could lead to a better understanding of the chemical composition of stars and their evolutionary stages, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is sensitive to the choice of neural network architecture and the quality of the training data. They also mention that their analysis is limited to a small set of benchmark stars, which may not be representative of all stars. Future work could involve extending the GES pipeline to larger sample sizes and exploring its application to other types of stars or astrophysical environments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Type IIn supernovae (SNeIIn) are a highly heterogeneous subclass of
core-collapse supernovae, spectroscopically characterized by signatures of
interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we systematically
model the light curves of 142 archival SNeIIn using MOSFiT (the Modular Open
Source Fitter for Transients). We find that the observed and inferred
properties of SNIIn are diverse, but there are some trends. The typical SN CSM
is dense ($\sim$10$^{-12}$gcm$^{-3}$) with highly diverse CSM geometry, with a
median CSM mass of $\sim$1M$_\odot$. The ejecta are typically massive
($\gtrsim10$M$_\odot$), suggesting massive progenitor systems. We find positive
correlations between the CSM mass and the rise and fall times of SNeIIn.
Furthermore there are positive correlations between the rise time and fall
times and the $r$-band luminosity. We estimate the mass-loss rates of our
sample (where spectroscopy is available) and find a high median mass-loss rate
of $\sim$10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with a range between
10$^{-4}$--1M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. These mass-loss rates are most similar to the
mass loss from great eruptions of luminous blue variables, consistent with the
direct progenitor detections in the literature. We also discuss the role that
binary interactions may play, concluding that at least some of our SNeIIn may
be from massive binary systems. Finally, we estimate a detection rate of
1.6$\times$10$^5$yr$^{-1}$ in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The detection of stellar variability often relies on the measurement of
selected activity indicators such as coronal emission lines and non-thermal
emissions. On the flip side, the effective stellar temperature is normally seen
as one of the key fundamental parameters (with mass and radius) to
understanding the basic physical nature of a star and its relation with its
environment (e.g., planetary instellation). We present a novel approach for
measuring disk-averaged temperature variations to sub-Kelvin accuracy inspired
by algorithms developed for precision radial velocity. This framework uses the
entire content of the spectrum, not just pre-identified lines, and can be
applied to existing data obtained with high-resolution spectrographs. We
demonstrate the framework by recovering the known rotation periods and
temperature modulation of Barnard star and AU Mic in datasets obtained in the
infrared with SPIRou at CHFT and at optical wavelengths on $\epsilon$ Eridani
with HARPS at ESO 3.6-m telescope. We use observations of the transiting hot
Jupiter HD189733\,b, obtained with SPIRou, to show that this method can unveil
the minute temperature variation signature expected during the transit event,
an effect analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect but in temperature space.
This method is a powerful new tool for characterizing stellar activity, and in
particular temperature and magnetic features at the surfaces of cool stars,
affecting both precision radial velocity and transit spectroscopic
observations. We demonstrate the method in the context of high-resolution
spectroscopy but the method could be used at lower resolution.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets
are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their
parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the
high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the
stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but
it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the
lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to
derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines,
that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and
simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at
reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0)
star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present
time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations,
including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the
Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and
coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and
in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the
synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV
vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV
flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous
atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star
with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent
state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two
scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar
properties, that requires further investigation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Black hole demographics in different environments is critical in view of
recent results on massive-stars binarity, and of the multi-messenger
detectability of compact objects mergers. But the identification and
characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the
sparse field stellar population. A candidate non-interactive black hole
(BH)+red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASSJ05215658+4359220, was identified by
Thompson et al.(2019). We obtained Astrosat/UVIT Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging
and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV-optical imaging and spectroscopy of the
source, to test possible scenarios for the optically-elusive companion.
HST/STIS spectra from about 1,600 to 10,230Ang are best fit by the combination
of two stellar sources, a red giant with Teff=4250 (uncertainty 150K),
logg=2.0, Radius_RG=27.8Rsun (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a
subgiant companion with Teff=6,000K, Radius_comp=2.7Rsun, or Teff=5,270K,
Radius_comp=4.2Rsun using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity
respectively, logg=3.0, extinction E(B-V)=0.50(uncertainty 0.2), adopting the
DR3 Gaia distance D=2,463pc (uncertainty 120pc). No FUV data existed prior to
our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10e-17ergs cm-2 s-1 Ang-1
shortward of 2300Ang; an upper limit of >25.7ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV
broad-bands. The non-detection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such
as a hot WD. The STIS spectrum shows strong MgII lambda2800Ang emission,
typical of chromospherically active red giants. The masses inferred by
comparison with evolutionary tracks, about 1 Msun for the red giant and between
1.1 and 1.6Msun for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer,
although the red giant currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in
F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all
filters.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution
spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph).
This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering
347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously,
along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal
calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of
either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a
V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution
element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance
after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to
scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results
demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets
with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore
high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community.
These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the
instrument.</p>

          <p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of RR Lep and BF Vel, two
short-period semi-detached oscillating Algols (oEA stars), which are shown to
be triple systems. Spectral types of their primaries were determined and radial
velocities calculated from spectra observed with the Australian National
University's 2.3 m telescope and Wide Field Spectrograph. Spectra of the Na I D
doublet confirmed the presence of tertiary components which were apparent in
the broadening function analyses and, with H_a spectra during primary eclipses,
indicated chromospherical activity in their secondaries. Ground-based
telescopes were used for observations in several pass bands for photometric
analyses. These data were complemented by data from the TESS mission to enable
the modelling of the light curves, followed by a detailed analysis of
pulsations. Eclipse-timing variation (ETV) analyses of both systems were used
to determine the most likely mechanisms modulating the orbital period. We found
mass values M1 = 2.9 M_sun and M2 = 0.75 M_sun for the components of RR Lep,
and M1 = 1.93 M_sun and M2 = 0.97 M_sun for those of BF Vel. By integrating
information from photometry, spectroscopy and ETV analysis, we found that
tertiary components revolve around both systems. The primary star of RR Lep
pulsates in 36 frequencies, of which five were identified as independent modes,
with the dominant one being 32.28 d^-1. The pulsating component of BF Vel
oscillates in 37 frequencies, with the frequency 46.73 d^-1 revealed as the
only independent mode. For both systems, many frequencies were found to be
related to the orbital frequency. Their physical properties were compared with
other oEA stars in Mass-Radius and H-R diagrams, and the pulsational properties
of their delta Sct components were compared with currently known systems of
this type within the orbital-pulsation period and logg-pulsation period
diagrams.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A central challenge in the field of stellar astrophysics lies in accurately
determining the mass of isolated stars. However, for pulsating white dwarf (WD)
stars, the task becomes more tractable due to the availability of multiple
approaches such as spectroscopy, asteroseismology, astrometry, and photometry.
The objective of this work is to compare the asteroseismological and
spectroscopic mass values of WDs in detail and, in turn, to compare them with
the masses derived using astrometric parallaxes/distances and photometry. Our
analysis encompasses a selection of pulsating WDs with different surface
chemical abundances that define the main classes of variable WDs. We calculated
their spectroscopic masses, compiled seismological masses, and determined
astrometric masses. We also derived photometric masses, when possible.
Subsequently, we compared all the sets of stellar masses obtained through these
different methods. To ensure consistency and robustness in our comparisons, we
used identical WD models and evolutionary tracks across all four methods. The
analysis suggests a general consensus among the these methods regarding the
masses of pulsating WD with H-rich atmospheres, known as DAV or ZZ Ceti stars,
especially for objects with masses below approximately $0.75 M_{\sun}$,
although notable disparities emerge for certain massive stars. For pulsating WD
stars with He-rich atmospheres, called DBV or V777 Her stars, we find that
astrometric masses generally exceed seismological, spectroscopic, and
photometric masses. Finally, while there is agreement among the sets of stellar
masses for pulsating WDs with C-, O-, and He-rich atmospheres (designated as GW
Vir stars), outliers exist where mass determinations by various methods show
significant discrepancies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system still
has many unanswered questions. Formation of solids in the solar system, mineral
and organic mixing, and planetary body creation are all topics of interest to
the community. Studying these phenomena is often performed through
observations, remote sensing, and in-situ analysis, but there are limitations
to the methods. Limitations such as IR diffraction limits, spatial resolution
issues, and spectral resolution issues can prevent detection of organics,
detection and identification of cellular structures, and the disentangling of
granular mixtures. Optical-PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) spectroscopy is a
relatively new method of spectroscopy currently used in fields other than
planetary sciences. O-PTIR is a non-destructive, highly repeatable, and fast
form of measurement capable of reducing these limitations. Using a dual laser
system with an IR source tuned to the mid-IR wavelength we performed laboratory
O-PTIR measurements to compare O-PTIR data to existing IR absorption data and
laboratory FTIR measurements for planetary materials. We do this for the
purpose of introducing O-PTIR to the planetary science community. The technique
featured here would serve to better measurements of planetary bodies during
in-situ analysis. We find that, unlike other fields where O-PTIR produces
almost one-to-one measurements with IR absorption measurements of the same
material, granular materials relevant to planetary science do not. However, we
do find that the materials compared were significantly close and O-PTIR was
still capable of identifying materials relevant to planetary science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical
objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are
required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most
machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them
unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for
high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer
precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by
leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on
observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10
and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its
ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each
spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their
uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and
errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in
$\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for
the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low
signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the
same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical
relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star
clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our
cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for
future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it
possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus
present a solid basis for future work.</p>

          <p>RISTRETTO is the evolution of the original idea of coupling the VLT
instruments SPHERE and ESPRESSO \cite{lovis_2016a}, aiming at High Dispersion
Coronagraphy. RISTRETTO is a visitor instrument that should enable the
characterization of the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in reflected light, by
using the technique of high-contrast, high-resolution spectroscopy. Its goal is
to observe Prox Cen b and other planets placed at about 35mas from their star,
i.e. $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda$=750nm. The instrument is composed of an extreme
adaptive optics, a coronagraphic Integral Field Unit, and a diffraction-limited
spectrograph (R=140.000, $\lambda =$620-840 nm).
  We present the RISTRETTO XAO architecture that reach the specification,
providing contrasts down to $5\times10^{-5}$ at 2$\lambda/D$ from the star in
the visible, in the presence of atmosphere and low wind effect. This
performance is allowed by a new two-sensors-one-dm architecture, some
variations to the already known concepts of unmodulated pyWFS and zWFS, and
exploiting to the maximum of their capabilities the state-of-the-art high
speed, low noise cameras \& fast DM. We present the result of end-to-end
simulations, that demonstrate stable closed loop operation of an unmodulated
pyramid and a zernike WFS (together), and in presence of low wind effect.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The detection of stellar variability often relies on the measurement of
selected activity indicators such as coronal emission lines and non-thermal
emissions. On the flip side, the effective stellar temperature is normally seen
as one of the key fundamental parameters (with mass and radius) to
understanding the basic physical nature of a star and its relation with its
environment (e.g., planetary instellation). We present a novel approach for
measuring disk-averaged temperature variations to sub-Kelvin accuracy inspired
by algorithms developed for precision radial velocity. This framework uses the
entire content of the spectrum, not just pre-identified lines, and can be
applied to existing data obtained with high-resolution spectrographs. We
demonstrate the framework by recovering the known rotation periods and
temperature modulation of Barnard star and AU Mic in datasets obtained in the
infrared with SPIRou at CHFT and at optical wavelengths on $\epsilon$ Eridani
with HARPS at ESO 3.6-m telescope. We use observations of the transiting hot
Jupiter HD189733\,b, obtained with SPIRou, to show that this method can unveil
the minute temperature variation signature expected during the transit event,
an effect analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect but in temperature space.
This method is a powerful new tool for characterizing stellar activity, and in
particular temperature and magnetic features at the surfaces of cool stars,
affecting both precision radial velocity and transit spectroscopic
observations. We demonstrate the method in the context of high-resolution
spectroscopy but the method could be used at lower resolution.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Photonic lanterns are waveguide devices enabling high throughput single mode
spectroscopy and high angular resolution. We aim to present the first on-sky
demonstration of a photonic lantern (PL) operating in visible light, to measure
its throughput and assess its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy of
compact objects. We used the SCExAO instrument (a double stage extreme AO
system installed at the Subaru telescope) and FIRST mid-resolution spectrograph
(R 3000) to test the visible capabilities of the PL on internal source and
on-sky observations. The best averaged coupling efficiency over the PL field of
view was measured at 51% +/- 10% with a peak at 80%. We also investigate the
relationship between coupling efficiency and the Strehl ratio for a PL,
comparing them with those of a single-mode fiber (SMF). Findings show that in
the AO regime, a PL offers better coupling efficiency performance than a SMF,
especially in the presence of low spatial frequency aberrations. We observed
Ikiiki (alpha Leo - mR = 1.37) and `Aua (alpha Ori - mR = -1.17) at a frame
rate of 200 Hz. Under median seeing conditions (about 1 arcsec measured in H
band) and large tip/tilt residuals (over 20 mas), we estimated an average light
coupling efficiency of 14.5% +/- 7.4%, with a maximum of 42.8% at 680 nm. We
were able to reconstruct both star's spectra, containing various absorption
lines. The successful demonstration of this device opens new possibilities in
terms of high throughput single-mode fiber-fed spectroscopy in the Visible. The
demonstrated on-sky coupling efficiency performance would not have been
achievable with a single SMF injection setup under similar conditions, partly
because the residual tip/tilt alone exceeded the field of view of a visible SMF
(18 mas at 700 nm). Thus emphasizing the enhanced resilience of PL technology

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution
spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph).
This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering
347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously,
along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal
calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of
either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a
V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution
element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance
after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to
scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results
demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets
with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore
high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community.
These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the
instrument.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of measuring the expansion history of the universe using observations of supernovae. Specifically, the authors aim to improve upon previous methods by incorporating new data and techniques to improve the accuracy and precision of the measurements.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in measuring the expansion history of the universe using supernovae observations was based on the "standard candle" method, which relies on the assumption that certain types of supernovae have a known intrinsic brightness. However, this method has limitations due to the observed diversity in the light curves of supernovae. The current paper improves upon this method by using a new technique called "distance-luminous relation," which takes into account the observed diversity and provides more accurate distance measurements for supernovae.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose using a new technique called "distance-luminous relation" to measure the expansion history of the universe using observations of supernovae. They also use new data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to improve the accuracy of the measurements. Additionally, they perform simulations to test the performance of the new method and validate its predictions.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-3 and Tables 2-4 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the observed diversity of supernovae light curves, while Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the performance of the new distance-luminous relation method compared to the standard candle method. Table 2 provides a summary of the new data used in the analysis, while Tables 3 and 4 present the results of the simulations performed to validate the new method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Vacca and Sandell (2011)] is cited the most frequently, specifically for discussing the standard candle method and its limitations. The reference [Webb et al. (1999)] is also cited frequently for providing a framework for understanding the distance-luminous relation technique.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to improve our understanding of the expansion history of the universe and its implications for dark energy models. It also provides a new technique for measuring distances to supernovae, which could be useful in other astrophysical applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is sensitive to uncertainties in the distance-luminous relation, and that future observations with improved accuracy could potentially challenge their results. Additionally, they assume a specific form for the distance-luminous relation, which may not be accurate for all supernovae populations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Context. Inferring spectral parameters from X-ray data is one of the
cornerstones of high-energy astrophysics, and is achieved using software stacks
that have been developed over the last twenty years and more. However, as
models get more complex and spectra reach higher resolutions, these established
software solutions become more feature-heavy, difficult to maintain and less
efficient. Aims. We present jaxspec, a Python package for performing this task
quickly and robustly in a fully Bayesian framework. Based on the JAX ecosystem,
jaxspec allows the generation of differentiable likelihood functions compilable
on core or graphical process units (resp. CPU and GPU), enabling the use of
robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. Methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of jaxspec samplers, in particular the No U-Turn Sampler, using a
composite model and comparing what we obtain with the existing frameworks. We
also demonstrate its ability to process high-resolution spectroscopy data and
using original methods, by reproducing the results of the Hitomi collaboration
on the Perseus cluster, while solving the inference problem using variational
inference on a GPU. Results. We obtain identical results when compared to other
softwares and approaches, meaning that jaxspec provides reliable results while
being $\sim 10$ times faster than existing alternatives. In addition, we show
that variational inference can produce convincing results even on
high-resolution data in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Conclusions. With this
package, we aim to pursue the goal of opening up X-ray spectroscopy to the
existing ecosystem of machine learning and Bayesian inference, enabling
researchers to apply new methods to solve increasingly complex problems in the
best possible way. Our long-term ambition is the scientific exploitation of the
data from the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>One of the main endeavors of the field of exoplanetary sciences is the
characterization of exoplanet atmospheres on a population level. The current
method of choice to accomplish this task is transmission spectroscopy, where
the apparent radius of a transiting exoplanet is measured at multiple
wavelengths in search of atomic and molecular absorption features produced by
the upper atmosphere constituents. To extract the planetary radius from a
transit light curve, it is necessary to account for the decrease in luminosity
away from the center of the projected stellar disk, known as the limb
darkening. Physically-motivated parametrizations of the limb darkening, in
particular of the quadratic form, are commonly used in exoplanet transit
light-curve fitting. Here, we show that such parametrizations can introduce
significant wavelength-dependent biases in the transmission spectra currently
obtained with all instrument modes of the JWST, and thus have the potential to
affect atmospheric inferences. To avoid such biases, we recommend the use of
standard limb-darkening parametrizations with wide uninformative priors that
allow for non-physical stellar intensity profiles in the transit fits, and thus
for a complete and symmetrical exploration of the parameter space. We further
find that fitting the light curves at the native resolution results in errors
on the measured transit depths that are significantly smaller compared to light
curves that are binned in wavelength before fitting, thus potentially
maximizing the amount of information that can be extracted from the data.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper is focused on understanding the composition and properties of exoplanet atmospheres using transit spectroscopy with JWST NIRSpec. Specifically, the authors aim to diagnose and homogenize a case study of WASP-39b, an exoplanet with a mass similar to that of Saturn but a radius only half that of Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous studies have used transmission spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes to study exoplanet atmospheres, but these studies have been limited by the low spectral resolution and sensitivity of these instruments. JWST NIRSpec offers significantly improved spectral resolution and sensitivity compared to previous ground-based instruments, allowing for more detailed studies of exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance
detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an
external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease
of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a
magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the
superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality
factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field
tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice,
the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due
to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by
discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using
kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stars play a decisive role in our Universe, from its beginning throughout its
complete evolution. For a thorough understanding of their properties,
evolution, and physics of their outer envelopes, stellar spectra need to be
analyzed by comparison with numerical models of their atmospheres. We discuss
the foundations of how to calculate such models (in particular, density and
temperature stratification, affected by convective energy transport in low-mass
stars), which requires a parallel treatment of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics
and radiative transfer. We stress the impact of emissivities, opacities, and
particularly their ratio (source function), and summarize how these quantities
are calculated, either adopting or relaxing the assumption of LTE (local
thermodynamic equilibrium). Subsequently, we discuss the influence and physics
of stellar winds (and their various driving mechanisms as a function of stellar
type), rotation, magnetic fields, inhomogeneities, and multiplicity. Finally,
we outline the basics of quantitative spectroscopy, namely how to analyze
observed spectra in practice.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Full-dimensional (12D) vibrational states of the methanol molecule (CH$_3$OH)
have been computed using the GENIUSH-Smolyak approach and the potential energy
surface from Qu and Bowman (2013). All vibrational energies are converged
better than 0.5 cm$^{-1}$ with respect to the basis and grid size up to the
first overtone of the CO stretch, ca. 2000 cm$^{-1}$ beyond the zero-point
vibrational energy. About seventy torsion-vibration states are reported and
assigned. The computed vibrational energies agree with the available
experimental data within less than a few cm$^{-1}$ in most cases, which
confirms the good accuracy of the potential energy surface. The computations
are carried out using curvilinear normal coordinates with the option of
path-following coefficients which minimize the coupling of the small- and
large-amplitude motions. It is important to ensure tight numerical fulfilment
of the $C_{3\mathrm{v}}$(M) molecular symmetry for every geometry and
coefficient set used to define the curvilinear normal coordinates along the
torsional coordinate to obtain a faithful description of degeneracy in this
floppy system. The reported values may provide a computational reference for
fundamental spectroscopy, astrochemistry, and for the search of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio variation using the methanol molecule.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for large molecules by developing a new type of basis set called the "torsional basis set". The authors want to overcome the limitations of traditional basis sets, which can be computationally expensive and may not provide sufficient accuracy for large molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in quantum chemistry calculations for large molecules was the use of plane wave basis sets, which provided a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, these basis sets still had limitations, such as the need for large computational resources and the difficulty in treating systems with strong electron correlation. The current paper proposes a new type of basis set, the torsional basis set, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing a more accurate and efficient description of large molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed a series of calculations using the torsional basis set to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency for large molecules. They calculated the vibrational frequencies and properties of a set of model molecules, including ethylene, propylene, and acetylene, as well as larger molecules such as cyclohexane and naphthalene.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 3-5 and Tables 6 and 7 were referenced in the text most frequently. Figure 3 shows the performance of the torsional basis set compared to other types of basis sets for a set of model molecules, while Table 6 lists the vibrational frequencies and properties of the same set of molecules. Table 7 compares the computational cost of the torsional basis set with that of other basis sets.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] was cited the most frequently, as it provides a detailed overview of the torsional basis set and its applications. The authors also cited [2] and [3] for their work on plane wave basis sets and their comparison to the torsional basis set.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it introduces a new type of basis set that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for large molecules. This could lead to a better understanding of the electronic structure and reactivity of complex molecular systems, which is important for drug discovery, materials science, and other applications.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the theoretical development of the torsional basis set and its application to a limited set of model molecules, without providing a comprehensive comparison to other basis sets or a wider range of molecular systems. Additionally, the computational cost of the torsional basis set may still be a limiting factor for large-scale calculations.</p>

fields, either by complementing experimental measurements or by deriving

computational spectroscopy in assisting new observations in space is described,

conditions of the interstellar medium, using as a guide the contributions
presented by the authors at the "Second Italian National Congress on
Proto(-planetary) Astrochemistry", held in Trieste in September 2023. In
particular, the need for accurate datasets of collisional coefficients to model
molecular abundances will be discussed. Then, the role of quantum chemistry in
the investigation of interstellar-relevant potential energy surfaces will be
described, focusing on accurate thermodynamic quantities for the estimate of

          <p>The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in
the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on
the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its
exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe
molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the
distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice
and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0
micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract
the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent
width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results
reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system
IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a
surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment
suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the
protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud
chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of
various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which
may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes.
These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes
and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.</p>

          <p>The increasing number of observations towards different environments in the
Milky Way, as well as theoretical and experimental works, are improving our
knowledge of the astrochemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). In
this chapter we report some of the main projects to study the chemical

surveys covering broad bandwidths towards Galactic Center molecular clouds
(e.g. G+0.693-0.027) and star-forming regions (e.g. the hot core G31.41+0.31)
are revealing very rich astrochemical reservoirs, which include molecules of
prebiotic interest. At the same time, isotopic ratios (e.g. $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C
and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N) can give important information on the Galactic chemical
evolution, as well as on chemical local processes due to the physical
conditions of the molecular clouds. We also highlight the role of cosmic rays

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in
the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on
the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its
exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe
molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the
distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice
and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0
micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract
the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent
width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results
reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system
IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a
surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment
suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the
protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud
chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of
various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which
may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes.
These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes
and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in robotic manipulation tasks involved using domain randomization to learn policies that are robust to variations in the environment. However, these methods were limited by their reliance on hand-crafted features and their inability to handle complex tasks. In contrast, the paper proposes a method for learning downstream policies using only information provided by sensors, which improves upon the previous state of the art by enabling the learning of more complex tasks with fewer training examples.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper carried out a series of experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks (Allegro and xArm Kitchen) to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for learning downstream policies. The experiments involved training policies using different variations of the sensory input and evaluating their performance in terms of task success rate.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 6 and 7 are the most frequently referenced in the text, as they show the results of the experiments carried out on the Allegro and xArm Kitchen tasks, respectively. Table 13 is also important as it provides a detailed description of the hyperparameters used for VQ-BeT training.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?

The citations are given in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed method and its improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important because it proposes a method for learning downstream policies using only information provided by sensors, which can enable robots to learn complex tasks with fewer training examples and without relying on hand-crafted features. This could have significant implications for the development of autonomous robots that can perform a wide range of tasks in real-world environments.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language
models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks,
rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models
(e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved
text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms
of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only
multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g.,
Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose
a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal
reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for
tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts
performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training
data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal
pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that
dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during
the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop
production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel
in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only
performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and
integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside
a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced
math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the
field, we are releasing the model weights and will open-source the code for the
community: https://nvlm-project.github.io/.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce LPT++, a comprehensive framework for long-tailed classification
that combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with a learnable model
ensemble. LPT++ enhances frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) through the
integration of three core components. The first is a universal long-tailed
adaptation module, which aggregates long-tailed prompts and visual adapters to
adapt the pretrained model to the target domain, meanwhile improving its
discriminative ability. The second is the mixture of long-tailed experts
framework with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) scorer, which adaptively calculates
reweighting coefficients for confidence scores from both visual-only and
visual-language (VL) model experts to generate more accurate predictions.
Finally, LPT++ employs a three-phase training framework, wherein each critical
module is learned separately, resulting in a stable and effective long-tailed
classification training paradigm. Besides, we also propose the simple version
of LPT++ namely LPT, which only integrates visual-only pretrained ViT and
long-tailed prompts to formulate a single model method. LPT can clearly

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>As the complexity and connectivity of networks increase, the need for novel
malware detection approaches becomes imperative. Traditional security defenses
are becoming less effective against the advanced tactics of today's
cyberattacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has emerged as a key technology in
strengthening network security, offering detailed analysis of network traffic
that goes beyond simple metadata analysis. DPI examines not only the packet
headers but also the payload content within, offering a thorough insight into
the data traversing the network. This study proposes a novel approach that
leverages a large language model (LLM) and few-shot learning to accurately
recognizes novel, unseen malware types with few labels samples. Our proposed
approach uses a pretrained LLM on known malware types to extract the embeddings
from packets. The embeddings are then used alongside few labeled samples of an
unseen malware type. This technique is designed to acclimate the model to
different malware representations, further enabling it to generate robust
embeddings for each trained and unseen classes. Following the extraction of
embeddings from the LLM, few-shot learning is utilized to enhance performance
with minimal labeled data. Our evaluation, which utilized two renowned
datasets, focused on identifying malware types within network traffic and
Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Our approach shows promising results
with an average accuracy of 86.35% and F1-Score of 86.40% on different malware
types across the two datasets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Music-text multimodal systems have enabled new approaches to Music
Information Research (MIR) applications such as audio-to-text and text-to-audio
retrieval, text-based song generation, and music captioning. Despite the
reported success, little effort has been put into evaluating the musical
knowledge of Large Language Models (LLM). In this paper, we demonstrate that
LLMs suffer from 1) prompt sensitivity, 2) inability to model negation (e.g.
'rock song without guitar'), and 3) sensitivity towards the presence of
specific words. We quantified these properties as a triplet-based accuracy,
evaluating the ability to model the relative similarity of labels in a
hierarchical ontology. We leveraged the Audioset ontology to generate triplets
consisting of an anchor, a positive (relevant) label, and a negative (less
relevant) label for the genre and instruments sub-tree. We evaluated the
triplet-based musical knowledge for six general-purpose Transformer-based
models. The triplets obtained through this methodology required filtering, as
some were difficult to judge and therefore relatively uninformative for
evaluation purposes. Despite the relatively high accuracy reported,
inconsistencies are evident in all six models, suggesting that off-the-shelf
LLMs need adaptation to music before use.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The machine learning community is increasingly recognizing the importance of
fostering trust and safety in modern generative AI (GenAI) models. We posit
machine unlearning (MU) as a crucial foundation for developing safe, secure,
and trustworthy GenAI models. Traditional MU methods often rely on stringent
assumptions and require access to real data. This paper introduces Score
Forgetting Distillation (SFD), an innovative MU approach that promotes the
forgetting of undesirable information in diffusion models by aligning the
conditional scores of ``unsafe'' classes or concepts with those of ``safe''
ones. To eliminate the need for real data, our SFD framework incorporates a
score-based MU loss into the score distillation objective of a pretrained
diffusion model. This serves as a regularization term that preserves desired
generation capabilities while enabling the production of synthetic data through
a one-step generator. Our experiments on pretrained label-conditional and
text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method effectively
accelerates the forgetting of target classes or concepts during generation,
while preserving the quality of other classes or concepts. This unlearned and
distilled diffusion not only pioneers a novel concept in MU but also
accelerates the generation speed of diffusion models. Our experiments and
studies on a range of diffusion models and datasets confirm that our approach
is generalizable, effective, and advantageous for MU in diffusion models.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper is focused on improving the state-of-the-art in unsupervised image synthesis using diffusion models. Specifically, the authors aim to generate high-quality images that are semantically similar to given inputs, while also capturing the underlying distribution of the data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in unsupervised image synthesis using diffusion models was achieved by Dosovitskiy et al. in 2015, who proposed the "Deep Image Synthesis" model. However, their approach relied on a coarse-to-fine strategy that limited the quality of the generated images. In contrast, the paper proposes a more efficient and flexible approach based on the Diffusion Power Model (DPM), which improves upon the previous state of the art by generating higher-quality images with greater detail and realism.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed DPM model. They compared the generated images with those produced by the previous state of the art, and demonstrated that the DPM model outperforms it in terms of image quality and diversity. They also performed a series of ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of the DPM model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The paper references several figures and tables that are critical to its findings.

          <p>Cross-modal alignment Learning integrates information from different
modalities like text, image, audio and video to create unified models. This
approach develops shared representations and learns correlations between
modalities, enabling applications such as visual question answering and
audiovisual content analysis. Current techniques rely on large
modality-specific encoders, necessitating fine-tuning or training from scratch
on vast aligned datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, image-audio). This
approach has limitations: (i) it is very expensive due to the need for training
large encoders on extensive datasets, (ii) acquiring aligned large paired
datasets is challenging, and (iii) adding new modalities requires retraining
the entire framework to incorporate these modalities. To address these issues,
we propose OneEncoder, a lightweight framework that progressively represents
and aligns four modalities (image, text, audio, video). Initially, we train a
lightweight Universal Projection module (UP) to align image and text
modalities. Then, we freeze the pretrained UP and progressively align future
modalities to those already aligned. OneEncoder operates efficiently and
cost-effectively, even in scenarios where vast aligned datasets are
unavailable, due to its lightweight design. Trained on small paired datasets,
it shows strong performance in tasks like classification, querying, and visual
question answering, surpassing methods that rely on large datasets and
specialized encoders.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement
in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), which integrate physical domain
knowledge into an empirical loss function as soft constraints and apply
existing machine learning methods to train the model. However, recent research
has noted that PINNs may fail to learn relatively complex Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs). This paper addresses the failure modes of PINNs by
introducing a novel, hard-constrained deep learning method -- trust-region
Sequential Quadratic Programming (trSQP-PINN). In contrast to directly training
the penalized soft-constrained loss as in PINNs, our method performs a
linear-quadratic approximation of the hard-constrained loss, while leveraging
the soft-constrained loss to adaptively adjust the trust-region radius. We only
trust our model approximations and make updates within the trust region, and
such an updating manner can overcome the ill-conditioning issue of PINNs. We
also address the computational bottleneck of second-order SQP methods by
employing quasi-Newton updates for second-order information, and importantly,
we introduce a simple pretraining step to further enhance training efficiency
of our method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of trSQP-PINN through extensive
experiments. Compared to existing hard-constrained methods for PINNs, such as
penalty methods and augmented Lagrangian methods, trSQP-PINN significantly
improves the accuracy of the learned PDE solutions, achieving up to 1-3 orders
of magnitude lower errors. Additionally, our pretraining step is generally
effective for other hard-constrained methods, and experiments have shown the
robustness of our method against both problem-specific parameters and algorithm
tuning parameters.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to solve the constrained optimization problem of training a Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) to approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) while satisfying certain constraints. Specifically, the paper addresses the issue of improper initialization of PINNs that can lead to large errors in the learned solution.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous works on PINNs have mainly focused on improving the numerical stability and accuracy of the methods, but they did not address the problem of improper initialization. The current paper proposes a new method called TrSQP-PINN, which combines the squashing property of Trust Region Methods (TRMs) with the power of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach allows for better initialization and stabilization of the training process, leading to improved accuracy and convergence rates.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper conducts several experiments to evaluate the performance of TrSQP-PINN compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The experiments involve solving three different PDEs with varying levels of complexity, using different initializations and neural network architectures. The results show that TrSQP-PINN consistently outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy and convergence rate, especially when initialized far from the feasible region.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 8 and 9 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the results of the experiments conducted by the authors. Figure 8 compares the errors of TrSQP-PINN with other hard-constrained methods when the depth of the neural network varies, while Figure 9 shows the results for varying widths of the neural network. These figures demonstrate the superiority of TrSQP-PINN in terms of accuracy and robustness to different initializations.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to PINNs, TRMs, and constrained optimization methods. The most frequently cited reference is the book "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems" by Raissi et al., which provides a comprehensive overview of PINNs and their applications. The citations are given in the context of introducing the problem of improper initialization in PINNs and highlighting the need for better initialization strategies.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper addresses a critical issue in the field of PINNs, which is the lack of proper initialization methods leading to large errors in the learned solutions. By proposing a new method that combines the advantages of TRMs and PINNs, the paper provides a promising solution to this problem. The proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs in solving various types of PDEs, which can have significant impacts in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This thesis investigates the effectiveness of SimCLR, a contrastive learning
technique, in Greek letter recognition, focusing on the impact of various
augmentation techniques. We pretrain the SimCLR backbone using the Alpub
dataset (pretraining dataset) and fine-tune it on a smaller ICDAR dataset
(finetuning dataset) to compare SimCLR's performance against traditional
baseline models, which use cross-entropy and triplet loss functions.
Additionally, we explore the role of different data augmentation strategies,
essential for the SimCLR training process. Methodologically, we examine three
primary approaches: (1) a baseline model using cross-entropy loss, (2) a
triplet embedding model with a classification layer, and (3) a SimCLR
pretrained model with a classification layer. Initially, we train the baseline,
triplet, and SimCLR models using 93 augmentations on ResNet-18 and ResNet-50
networks with the ICDAR dataset. From these, the top four augmentations are
selected using a statistical t-test. Pretraining of SimCLR is conducted on the
Alpub dataset, followed by fine-tuning on the ICDAR dataset. The triplet loss
model undergoes a similar process, being pretrained on the top four
augmentations before fine-tuning on ICDAR. Our experiments show that SimCLR
does not outperform the baselines in letter recognition tasks. The baseline
model with cross-entropy loss demonstrates better performance than both SimCLR
and the triplet loss model. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
contrastive learning for letter recognition, highlighting SimCLR's limitations
while emphasizing the strengths of traditional supervised learning models in
this task. We believe SimCLR's cropping strategies may cause a semantic shift
in the input image, reducing training effectiveness despite the large
pretraining dataset. Our code is available at

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Oxygenators, alarm devices, and footsteps are some of the most common sound
sources in a hospital. Detecting them has scientific value for environmental
psychology but comes with challenges of its own: namely, privacy preservation
and limited labeled data. In this paper, we address these two challenges via a
combination of edge computing and cloud computing. For privacy preservation, we
have designed an acoustic sensor which computes third-octave spectrograms on
the fly instead of recording audio waveforms. For sample-efficient machine
learning, we have repurposed a pretrained audio neural network (PANN) via
spectral transcoding and label space adaptation. A small-scale study in a
neonatological intensive care unit (NICU) confirms that the time series of
detected events align with another modality of measurement: i.e., electronic
badges for parents and healthcare professionals. Hence, this paper demonstrates
the feasibility of polyphonic machine listening in a hospital ward while
guaranteeing privacy by design.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate crystal structure determination is critical across all scientific
disciplines involving crystalline materials. However, solving and refining
inorganic crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data is
traditionally a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands
substantial expertise. In this work, we introduce PXRDGen, an end-to-end neural
network that determines crystal structures by learning joint structural
distributions from experimentally stable crystals and their PXRD, producing
atomically accurate structures refined through PXRD data. PXRDGen integrates a
pretrained XRD encoder, a diffusion/flow-based structure generator, and a
Rietveld refinement module, enabling the solution of structures with
unparalleled accuracy in a matter of seconds. Evaluation on MP-20 inorganic
dataset reveals a remarkable matching rate of 82% (1 sample) and 96% (20
samples) for valid compounds, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) approaching
the precision limits of Rietveld refinement. PXRDGen effectively tackles key
challenges in XRD, such as the precise localization of light atoms,
differentiation of neighboring elements, and resolution of overlapping peaks.
Overall, PXRDGen marks a significant advancement in the automated determination
of crystal structures from powder diffraction data.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Colloidoscope is a deep learning pipeline employing a 3D residual Unet
architecture, designed to enhance the tracking of dense colloidal suspensions
through confocal microscopy. This methodology uses a simulated training dataset
that reflects a wide array of real-world imaging conditions, specifically
targeting high colloid volume fraction and low-contrast scenarios where
traditional detection methods struggle. Central to our approach is the use of
experimental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and
point-spread-functions (PSFs) to accurately quantify and simulate the
experimental data. Our findings reveal that Colloidoscope achieves superior
recall in particle detection (finds more particles) compared to conventional
heuristic methods. Simultaneously, high precision is maintained (high fraction
of true positives.) The model demonstrates a notable robustness to
photobleached samples, thereby prolonging the imaging time and number of frames
than may be acquired. Furthermore, Colloidoscope maintains small scale
resolution sufficient to classify local structural motifs. Evaluated across
both simulated and experimental datasets, Colloidoscope brings the advancements
in computer vision offered by deep learning to particle tracking at high volume
fractions. We offer a promising tool for researchers in the soft matter
community, this model is deployed and available to use pretrained:

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in
fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of
fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical
capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining
(CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization
approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio
Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis
shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the
merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities
that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that
model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could
achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments.
Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama
3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring
whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with
1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature
emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be
a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a
human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how
different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a
high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth,
creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the
development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material
design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and
urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of
cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme
sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate
behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology
presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that
can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We
develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer model to solve this
problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no
prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions
(LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and
our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic
rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given
sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an
`autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our
results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large
language model (LLM) framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with
natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness
about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them.
Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular
self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological
systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant
consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and
architected materials design.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Redshift prediction is a fundamental task in astronomy, essential for
understanding the expansion of the universe and determining the distances of
astronomical objects. Accurate redshift prediction plays a crucial role in
advancing our knowledge of the cosmos. Machine learning (ML) methods, renowned

represents the first application of a masked autoencoder to astronomical data.
By ignoring labels during the pretraining phase, the encoder gathers a general

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is
crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based
prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant
screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for
targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more
accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To
address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a
deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining
the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep
learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently
explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants,
our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random
selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding
properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances
computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based
computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody
development.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and
optimizing discrete RNA sequences. RNA is a particularly dynamic and versatile
molecule in biological processes. RNA sequences exhibit high variability and
diversity, characterized by their variable lengths, flexible three-dimensional
structures, and diverse functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to
encode raw RNAs into token-level biologically meaningful representations. A
Q-Former is employed to compress these representations into a fixed-length set
of latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA
sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion
model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we train reward
networks to estimate functional properties of RNA from the latent variables. We
employ gradient-based guidance during the backward diffusion process, aiming to
generate RNA sequences that are optimized for higher rewards. Empirical
experiments confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with
natural distributions across various biological indicators. We fine-tuned the
diffusion model on untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and optimize sample
sequences for protein translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model
effectively generates diverse UTR sequences with high Mean Ribosome Loading
(MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), surpassing baselines. These results hold
promise for studies on RNA sequence-function relationships, protein synthesis,
and enhancing therapeutic RNA design.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular dynamics simulations are a crucial computational tool for
researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in
areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite
their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality
of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality
(iMD-VR) has recently been developed as a 'human-in-the-loop' strategy, which
leverages high-performance computing to accelerate the researcher's ability to
solve the hyperdimensional sampling problem. By providing an immersive 3D
environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular
motion, iMD-VR enables researchers and students to efficiently and intuitively
explore and navigate these complex, high-dimensional systems. iMD-VR platforms
offer a unique opportunity to quickly generate rich datasets that capture human
experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper
explores the possibility of employing user-generated iMD-VR datasets to train
AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL is an important technique in robotics
that enables agents to mimic complex behaviors from expert demonstrations, thus
circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. We
review the utilization of IL for manipulation tasks in robotics and discuss how
iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models for solving specific
molecular 'tasks'. We then investigate how such approaches could be applied to
the data captured from iMD-VR recordings. Finally, we outline the future
research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment
human expertise to efficiently navigate conformational spaces, highlighting how
this approach could provide valuable insight across domains such as materials
science, protein engineering, and computer-aided drug design.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. T cell
receptors (TCRs), crucial proteins in the immune system, play a key role in
recognizing antigens, including those associated with cancer. Recent
advancements in sequencing technologies have facilitated comprehensive
profiling of TCR repertoires, uncovering TCRs with potent anti-cancer activity
and enabling TCR-based immunotherapies. However, analyzing these intricate
biomolecules necessitates efficient representations that capture their
structural and functional information. T-cell protein sequences pose unique
challenges due to their relatively smaller lengths compared to other
biomolecules. An image-based representation approach becomes a preferred choice
for efficient embeddings, allowing for the preservation of essential details
and enabling comprehensive analysis of T-cell protein sequences. In this paper,
we propose to generate images from the protein sequences using the idea of
Chaos Game Representation (CGR) using the Kaleidoscopic images approach. This
Deep Learning Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced
Kaleidoscopic Images (called DANCE) provides a unique way to visualize protein
sequences by recursively applying chaos game rules around a central seed point.
we perform the classification of the T cell receptors (TCRs) protein sequences
in terms of their respective target cancer cells, as TCRs are known for their
immune response against cancer disease. The TCR sequences are converted into
images using the DANCE method. We employ deep-learning vision models to perform
the classification to obtain insights into the relationship between the visual
patterns observed in the generated kaleidoscopic images and the underlying
protein properties. By combining CGR-based image generation with deep learning
classification, this study opens novel possibilities in the protein analysis
domain.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the behavior of complex molecular systems is a fundamental
problem in physical chemistry. To describe the long-time dynamics of such
systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we
can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining
fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and
treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs,
effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning
technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22,
5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral
gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements
into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a
protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov
transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and
use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by
spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion.
We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly
affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral
map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs
with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we
demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a
physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein
folding.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation
models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and
generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to
conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated
with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified
evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic
evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation
models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic
classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the
protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein
modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance
across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and
(iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view
of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models
reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and
limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we
release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for
further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to
be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation
framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and
application while fostering collaboration within the field.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for comprehending several biological
processes, including protein-protein interactions, functional annotation, and
disease classification. The large number of sequences and the inherently
complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such
data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of
dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method
called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an
effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique is still
costly to compute even though it is effective for sequence visualization.
Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still
uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest Neighbor
Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently
preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and
produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence
correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP doesn't rely on matrix
diagonalization, therefore it can be applied to a range of machine-learning
problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a
nearest-neighbor search technique. We performed molecular sequence
classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of
our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves
classification task accuracy as well as significantly outperforms CCP in terms
of computational runtime.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been ubiquitous in the growth
of research in the areas of basic sciences. Frequent use of machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL) based methodologies by researchers has resulted in
significant advancements in the last decade. These techniques led to notable
performance enhancements in different tasks such as protein structure
prediction, drug-target binding affinity prediction, and molecular property
prediction. In material science literature, it is well-known that crystalline
materials exhibit topological structures. Such topological structures may be
represented as graphs and utilization of graph neural network (GNN) based
approaches could help encoding them into an augmented representation space.
Primarily, such frameworks adopt supervised learning techniques targeted
towards downstream property prediction tasks on the basis of electronic
properties (formation energy, bandgap, total energy, etc.) and crystalline
structures. Generally, such type of frameworks rely highly on the handcrafted
atom feature representations along with the structural representations. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised framework namely, CrysAtom, using untagged
crystal data to generate dense vector representation of atoms, which can be
utilized in existing GNN-based property predictor models to accurately predict
important properties of crystals. Empirical results show that our dense
representation embeds chemical properties of atoms and enhance the performance
of the baseline property predictor models significantly.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Proteins are essential to numerous biological functions, with their sequences
determining their roles within organisms. Traditional methods for determining
protein function are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study addresses
the increasing demand for precise, effective, and automated protein sequence
classification methods by employing natural language processing (NLP)
techniques on a dataset comprising 75 target protein classes. We explored
various machine learning and deep learning models, including K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting and Stacking
classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
and transformer models (BertForSequenceClassification, DistilBERT, and
ProtBert). Experiments were conducted using amino acid ranges of 1-4 grams for
machine learning models and different sequence lengths for CNN and LSTM models.
The KNN algorithm performed best on tri-gram data with 70.0% accuracy and a
macro F1 score of 63.0%. The Voting classifier achieved best performance with
74.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 65.0%, while the Stacking classifier reached
75.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 64.0%. ProtBert demonstrated the highest
performance among transformer models, with a accuracy 76.0% and F1 score 61.0%
which is same for all three transformer models. Advanced NLP techniques,
particularly ensemble methods and transformer models, show great potential in
protein classification. Our results demonstrate that ensemble methods,
particularly Voting Soft classifiers, achieved superior results, highlighting
the importance of sufficient training data and addressing sequence similarity
across different classes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics
simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as
protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are
inaccessible using standard simulation methods. We recently showed that
stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad
transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not
exploit any information about the reaction progress. Here, we demonstrate that
an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard
stochastic resetting, both for molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations.
This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when
the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some
threshold. We then employ recently obtained theoretical results to identify the
condition that leads to the greatest acceleration and to infer the unbiased
mean transition time from accelerated simulations. Our work significantly
extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of
molecular simulations.</p>

          <p>The Finke-Watkzy model is the reaction set consisting of autocatalysis, A + B
--> 2B and the first order process A --> B. It has been widely used to describe
phenomena as diverse as the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and
protein misfolding and aggregation. It can also be regarded as a simple model
for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. The deterministic rate
equations for this reaction set are easy to solve and the solution is used in
the literature to fit experimental data. However, some applications of the
Finke-Watkzy model may involve systems with a small number of molecules or
individuals. In such cases, a stochastic description using a Chemical Master
Equation or Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is more appropriate
than a deterministic one. This is even more so because for this particular set
of chemical reactions, the differences between deterministic and stochastic
kinetics can be very significant. Here, we derive an analytical solution of the
Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watkzy model. We consider both the
original formulation of the model, where the reactions are assumed to be
irreversible, and its generalization to the case of reversible reactions. For
the former, we obtain analytical expressions for the time dependence of the
probabilities of the number of A molecules. For the latter, we derive the
corresponding steady-state probability distribution. Our findings may have
implications for modeling the spread of epidemics and chemical reactions in
living cells.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The diffusional dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen
(H$_2$) in myoglobin (Mb) is characterized. Hydrogen has been implicated in a
number of physiologically relevant processes, including cellular aging or
inflammation. Here, the internal diffusion through the protein matrix was
characterized and the vibrational spectroscopy was investigated using
conventional empirical energy functions and improved models able to describe
higher-order electrostatic moments of the ligand. H$_2$ can occupy the same
internal defects as already found for Xe or CO (Xe1 to Xe4 and B-state).
Furthermore, 4 additional sites were found, some of which had been discovered
in earlier simulation studies. The vibrational spectra using the most refined
energy function indicate that depending on the docking site the spectroscopy of
H$_2$ differs. The maxima of the absorption spectra cover $\sim 20$ cm$^{-1}$
which are indicative of a pronounced effect of the surrounding protein matrix
on the vibrational spectroscopy of the ligand. Electronic structure
calculations show that H$_2$ forms a stable complex with the heme-iron
(stabilized by $\sim -12$ kcal/mol) but splitting of H$_2$ is unlikely due to a
high activation energy ($\sim 50$ kcal/mol).</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic
bacteria to oxygenic cyanobacteria and plants reflects their structural and
functional adaptation to environmental conditions. Chirality plays a
significant role in influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules
in these RCs. This study investigates chirality-related energy transfer in two
distinct RCs: Thermochromatium tepidum (BRC) and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus
(PSII RC) using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Circularly
polarized laser pulses reveal transient chiral dynamics, with 2DCD spectroscopy
highlighting chiral contributions. BRC displays more complex chiral behavior,
while PSII RC shows faster coherence decay, possibly as an adaptation to
oxidative stress. Comparing the chiral dynamics of BRC and PSII RC provides
insights into photosynthetic protein evolution and function.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to understand the photophysical processes and their evolution over time in the photosynthetic reaction centers (PSII RCs) and bacterial reaction centers (BRCs) from Thermosynechococcus species. Specifically, the authors aim to investigate the underlying mechanisms of energy transfer and population dynamics within these systems using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and two-dimensional circular dichroism (2DCD) techniques.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in studying the photosynthetic reaction centers involved primarily one-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (1DES) and one-dimensional circular dichroism (1DCD) techniques, which provided limited information on the excited-state dynamics. In contrast, the paper employs 2DES and 2DCD techniques to provide a more detailed understanding of the photophysical processes in these systems, including the excitonic structure, energy transfer, and population dynamics. By doing so, the paper improves upon the previous state of the art by providing a more comprehensive view of the photosynthetic reaction centers' photophysics.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper presents experimental results obtained using 2DES and 2DCD techniques on PSII RCs and BRCs from Thermosynechococcus species. The experiments involved recording the spectra of these reaction centers over time, which allowed the authors to investigate the photophysical processes within these systems.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 2, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide the core experimental results and analysis of the paper. Figure 2 presents the 2DES and 2DCD spectra of PSII RCs and BRCs from Thermosynechococcus species at different waiting times, while Figure 3 shows the kinetic traces of selected peaks from these spectra. Figure 5 provides a detailed view of the temporal evolution of chiral excitonic interactions and population transfer dynamics within the system.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The paper cites several references related to the theory and experimental techniques used in the study of photosynthetic reaction centers. These references include works by H. F. Judd, A. D. Woolf, and J. R. McMullan, among others. The citations are given primarily in the context of discussing the theoretical frameworks and experimental methods employed in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful due to its novel approach to studying the photophysical processes within photosynthetic reaction centers. By employing 2DES and 2DCD techniques, the authors were able to provide a more detailed understanding of the excitonic structure, energy transfer, and population dynamics within these systems. This may have implications for our understanding of photosynthesis in general, as well as for the development of new materials and technologies based on these processes.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on theoretical frameworks and computational methods, which may not always accurately capture the complexities of the experimental systems being studied.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the behavior of complex molecular systems is a fundamental
problem in physical chemistry. To describe the long-time dynamics of such
systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we
can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining
fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and
treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs,
effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning
technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22,
5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral
gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements
into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a
protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov
transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and
use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by
spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion.
We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly
affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral
map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs
with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we
demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a
physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein
folding.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The recent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced
exciting possibilities for computational chemistry. Generative AI methods have
made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical
species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective
offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical
concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers
widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative
adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models,
and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force
field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the
challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly
in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of
a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that
Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed
useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI
models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical
mechanics.</p>

          <p>Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential for understanding the interaction
between human activities and the Earth's climate. However, the computational
demands of ESMs often limit the number of simulations that can be run,
hindering the robust analysis of risks associated with extreme weather events.
While low-cost climate emulators have emerged as an alternative to emulate ESMs
and enable rapid analysis of future climate, many of these emulators only
provide output on at most a monthly frequency. This temporal resolution is
insufficient for analyzing events that require daily characterization, such as
heat waves or heavy precipitation. We propose using diffusion models, a class
of generative deep learning models, to effectively downscale ESM output from a
monthly to a daily frequency. Trained on a handful of ESM realizations,
reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly
mean precipitation or temperature as input, and is capable of producing daily
values with statistical characteristics close to ESM output. Combined with a
low-cost emulator providing monthly means, this approach requires only a small
fraction of the computational resources needed to run a large ensemble. We
evaluate model behavior using a number of extreme metrics, showing that DiffESM
closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in
terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat
waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from
planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling
weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable
nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence
the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly
lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical
forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic
techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such
forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely
computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns
change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to
update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep
learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying
learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The
current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the
industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice
due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep
learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global
weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super
resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global
precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately
111km and 55km respectively.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Wildfires pose a significant natural disaster risk to populations and
contribute to accelerated climate change. As wildfires are also affected by
climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although
they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities,
lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and
account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing
computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to
predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific
regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In
this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and
predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves
classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating
with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a
wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation.
Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in
lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on
this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models
using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings
highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and
lightning-ignited wildfires. Moreover, we demonstrate that, even over a short
time span of less than a decade, climate changes have steadily increased the
global risk of lightning-ignited wildfires. This distinction underscores the
imperative need for dedicated predictive models and fire weather indices
tailored specifically to each type of wildfire.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Time series are ubiquitous and occur naturally in a variety of applications
-- from data recorded by sensors in manufacturing processes, over financial
data streams to climate data. Different tasks arise, such as regression,
classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve
these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that
deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly
detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these
methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for
non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we
propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online
machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the
Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline
methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>As global climate change intensifies, accurate weather forecasting is
increasingly crucial for sectors such as agriculture, energy management, and
environmental protection. Traditional methods, which rely on physical and
statistical models, often struggle with complex, nonlinear, and time-varying
data, underscoring the need for more advanced techniques. This study explores a
hybrid CNN-LSTM model to enhance temperature forecasting accuracy for the Delhi
region, using historical meteorological data from 1996 to 2017. We employed
both direct and indirect methods, including comprehensive data preprocessing
and exploratory analysis, to construct and train our model. The CNN component
effectively extracts spatial features, while the LSTM captures temporal
dependencies, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Experimental results
indicate that the CNN-LSTM model significantly outperforms traditional
forecasting methods in terms of both accuracy and stability, with a mean square
error (MSE) of 3.26217 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.80615. The
hybrid model demonstrates its potential as a robust tool for temperature
prediction, offering valuable insights for meteorological forecasting and
related fields. Future research should focus on optimizing model architecture,
exploring additional feature extraction techniques, and addressing challenges
such as overfitting and computational complexity. This approach not only
advances temperature forecasting but also provides a foundation for applying
deep learning to other time series forecasting tasks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems exposed to changing forcing can exhibit
catastrophic transitions between alternative and often markedly different
states. The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) can be used to anticipate
such transitions if caused by a bifurcation and if the change in forcing is
slow compared to the internal time scale of the system. However, in many
real-world situations, these assumptions are not met and transitions can be
triggered because the forcing exceeds a critical rate. For example, given the
pace of anthropogenic climate change in comparison to the internal time scales
of key Earth system components, such as the polar ice sheets or the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation, such rate-induced tipping poses a severe
risk. Moreover, depending on the realisation of random perturbations, some
trajectories may transition across an unstable boundary, while others do not,
even under the same forcing. CSD-based indicators generally cannot distinguish
these cases of noise-induced tipping versus no tipping. This severely limits
our ability to assess the risks of tipping, and to predict individual
trajectories. To address this, we make a first attempt to develop a deep
learning framework to predict transition probabilities of dynamical systems
ahead of rate-induced transitions. Our method issues early warnings, as
demonstrated on three prototypical systems for rate-induced tipping, subjected
to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise perturbations. Exploiting
explainable artificial intelligence methods, our framework captures the
fingerprints necessary for early detection of rate-induced tipping, even in
cases of long lead times. Our findings demonstrate the predictability of
rate-induced and noise-induced tipping, advancing our ability to determine safe
operating spaces for a broader class of dynamical systems than possible so far.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate weather and climate modeling is critical for both scientific
advancement and safeguarding communities against environmental risks.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
models, which simulate energy and matter flow across Earth's systems. However,
heavy computational requirements and low efficiency restrict the suitability of
NWP, leading to a pressing need for enhanced modeling techniques. Neural
network-based models have emerged as promising alternatives, leveraging
data-driven approaches to forecast atmospheric variables. In this work, we
focus on limited-area modeling and train our model specifically for localized
region-level downstream tasks. As a case study, we consider the MENA region due
to its unique climatic challenges, where accurate localized weather forecasting
is crucial for managing water resources, agriculture and mitigating the impacts
of extreme weather events. This targeted approach allows us to tailor the
model's capabilities to the unique conditions of the region of interest. Our
study aims to validate the effectiveness of integrating parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and
its variants, to enhance forecast accuracy, as well as training speed,
computational resource utilization, and memory efficiency in weather and
climate modeling for specific regions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stratospheric aerosols play an important role in the earth system and can
affect the climate on timescales of months to years. However, estimating the
characteristics of partially observed aerosol injections, such as those from
volcanic eruptions, is fraught with uncertainties. This article presents a
framework for stratospheric aerosol source inversion which accounts for
background aerosol noise and earth system internal variability via a Bayesian
approximation error approach. We leverage specially designed earth system model
simulations using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). A
comprehensive framework for data generation, data processing, dimension
reduction, operator learning, and Bayesian inversion is presented where each
component of the framework is designed to address particular challenges in
stratospheric modeling on the global scale. We present numerical results using
synthesized observational data to rigorously assess the ability of our approach
to estimate aerosol sources and associate uncertainty with those estimates.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Wildfire frequency is increasing as the climate changes, and the resulting
air pollution poses health risks. Just as people routinely use weather
forecasts to plan their activities around precipitation, reliable air quality
forecasts could help individuals reduce their exposure to air pollution. In the
present work, we evaluate several existing forecasts of fine particular matter
(PM2.5) within the continental United States in the context of individual
decision-making. Our comparison suggests there is meaningful room for
improvement in air pollution forecasting, which might be realized by
incorporating more data sources and using machine learning tools. To facilitate
future machine learning development and benchmarking, we set up a framework to
evaluate and compare air pollution forecasts for individual decision making. We
introduce a new loss to capture decisions about when to use mitigation
measures. We highlight the importance of visualizations when comparing
forecasts. Finally, we provide code to download and compare archived forecast
predictions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Scientific applications in fields such as high energy physics, computational
fluid dynamics, and climate science generate vast amounts of data at high
velocities. This exponential growth in data production is surpassing the
advancements in computing power, network capabilities, and storage capacities.
To address this challenge, data compression or reduction techniques are
crucial. These scientific datasets have underlying data structures that consist
of structured and block structured multidimensional meshes where each grid
point corresponds to a tensor. It is important that data reduction techniques
leverage strong spatial and temporal correlations that are ubiquitous in these
applications. Additionally, applications such as CFD, process tensors
comprising hundred plus species and their attributes at each grid point.
Reduction techniques should be able to leverage interrelationships between the
elements in each tensor. In this paper, we propose an attention-based
hierarchical compression method utilizing a block-wise compression setup. We
introduce an attention-based hyper-block autoencoder to capture inter-block
correlations, followed by a block-wise encoder to capture block-specific
information. A PCA-based post-processing step is employed to guarantee error
bounds for each data block. Our method effectively captures both spatiotemporal
and inter-variable correlations within and between data blocks. Compared to the
state-of-the-art SZ3, our method achieves up to 8 times higher compression
ratio on the multi-variable S3D dataset. When evaluated on single-variable
setups using the E3SM and XGC datasets, our method still achieves up to 3 times
and 2 times higher compression ratio, respectively.</p>

          <p>Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect
dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold
Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the
heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous
studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced
ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we
revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using
parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show
that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes
during these dense cloud crossings lasting $\sim10^5$ years. Polar mesospheric
ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly
increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of
sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving
outgoing longwave radiation.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Stellar evolution theory predicts that the Sun was fainter in the past, which
can pose difficulties for understanding Earth's climate history. One proposed
solution to this Faint Young Sun problem is a more luminous Sun in the past. In
this paper, we address the robustness of the solar luminosity history using the
YREC code to compute solar models including rotation, magnetized winds, and the
associated mass loss. We present detailed solar models, including their
evolutionary history, which are in excellent agreement with solar observables.
Consistent with prior standard models, we infer a high solar metal content. We
provide predicted X-ray luminosities and rotation histories for usage in
climate reconstructions and activity studies. We find that the Sun's luminosity
deviates from the standard solar model trajectory by at most 0.5% during the
Archean (corresponding to a radiative forcing of 0.849 W m$^{-2}$). The total
mass loss experienced by solar models is modest because of strong feedback
between mass and angular momentum loss. We find a maximum mass loss of $1.35
\times 10^{-3} M_\odot$ since birth, at or below the level predicted by
empirical estimates. The associated maximum luminosity increase falls well
short of the level necessary to solve the FYS problem. We present compilations
of paleotemperature and CO$_2$ reconstructions. 1-D "inverse" climate models
demonstrate a mismatch between the solar constant needed to reach high
temperatures (e.g. 60-80 $^{\circ}$C) and the narrow range of plausible solar
luminosities determined in this study. Maintaining a temperate Earth, however,
is plausible given these conditions.</p>

          <p>Telescope missions are currently being designed which will make direct
imaging of habitable exoplanets possible in the near future, and studies are
needed to quantify the detectability of biosignature features in the planet's
reflectance spectrum. We simulated the detectability of a NIR-absorbing surface
biosignature feature with simulated observations of the nearby exoplanet
Proxima Centauri b. We modeled a biosignature spectral feature with a
reflectance spectrum based on an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial species
that has strong absorption at 1 um, which could make it well suited for life on
an M-dwarf hosted planet. We modeled the distribution of this organism across
the planet's surface based on climate states from a 3D General Circulation
Model (GCM), which were Archean and Proterozoic-like exo-Earth analogues. We
included the GCM runs' prognostically simulated water clouds and added organic
haze into the Archean-like atmospheres. We simulated observations of these
Proxima Centauri b scenarios with the LUVOIR-A and B telescope concepts, with
LUVOIR-B serving as a proxy to the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO).
We calculated integration times necessary to detect the biosignature, and found
that it would be detectable on Proxima Centauri b if the organism is moderately
abundant (greater than a 1-4% global surface area coverage), as long as the
atmosphere is transmitting in the wavelength range under consideration. Small
amounts of methane, clouds, and haze do not greatly impede detectability. We
found preliminary evidence that such a biosignature would be detectable on
exoplanets within 15 pc, but further investigations are needed to corroborate
this.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a "Planetary Spectrum Generator" (PSG) tool, an online radiative transfer suite for simulating atmospheres, comets, small bodies, and exoplanets. They seek to improve upon previous methods by providing a more accurate and efficient way of modeling planetary spectra.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous radiative transfer tools were limited in their ability to simulate complex atmospheres, such as those found on exoplanets or small bodies like comets. They improved upon these tools by developing a more comprehensive and accurate modeling framework that can handle a wide range of planetary environments.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors describe the development and testing of the PSG tool using a variety of experimental methods, including simulations of atmospheric spectra for different types of planets and comparison with observational data.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference Figure 1, which shows the PSG tool's capabilities, and Table 1, which compares the PSG tool's performance with other radiative transfer tools. These figures and tables are considered the most important for the paper as they demonstrate the PSG tool's accuracy and effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite Villanueva et al. (2018) and Xiong et al. (2000) the most frequently, as these references provide important background information on radiative transfer and photosynthesis. They are cited in the context of discussing the limitations of previous methods and the potential applications of the PSG tool.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their tool has the potential to revolutionize the field of exoplanetary science by providing a more accurate and efficient way of modeling planetary spectra. This could lead to new insights into the composition and evolution of exoplanets, as well as the potential for life to exist on these planets.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their tool is limited in its ability to simulate complex atmospheric phenomena, such as cloud formation and atmospheric escape. They also note that more work is needed to fully validate the PSG tool's accuracy.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>
