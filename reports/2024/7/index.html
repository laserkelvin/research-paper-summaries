          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>3D Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks have demonstrated notable
success in modeling complex physical systems. We introduce a framework for
relaxed $E(3)$ graph equivariant neural networks that can learn and represent
symmetry breaking within continuous groups. Building on the existing e3nn
framework, we propose the use of relaxed weights to allow for controlled
symmetry breaking. We show empirically that these relaxed weights learn the
correct amount of symmetry breaking.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a novel approach to graph neural networks (GNNs) that preserves the symmetry of the input graph while still capturing its structural information. They propose relaxed equivariant GNNs, which combine the equivariance of the traditional GNNs with the ability to break symmetries in specific layers, enabling the modeling of a wider range of graph structures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors build upon the existing body of work on GNNs and symmetry-preserving neural networks (SP-GNNs). They demonstrate that their proposed approach leads to improved performance compared to traditional GNNs and SP-GNNs in various tasks, particularly in modeling graphs with high symmetry.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct experiments on several graph classification tasks, including shape deformations and a particle in an electromagnetic field. They show that their proposed approach leads to improved performance compared to traditional GNNs and SP-GNNs in these tasks as well.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, 3, and Tables 1, 2, and 4 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the problem statement and the proposed approach of the paper, while Figure 2 shows the architecture of the relaxed equivariant GNN model. Table 1 provides a summary of the experimental setup, and Table 2 compares the performance of different models on various tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several papers related to GNNs and SP-GNNs, including Bruna et al. (2014), Kipf & Welling (2017), and Xu et al. (2019). They provide these citations to demonstrate the relevance of their proposed approach to existing work in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed approach has the potential to enable new applications in graph-structured data, such as modeling complex molecular structures and understanding social networks. They also highlight the importance of preserving symmetries in neural network models, particularly in tasks involving physical simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed approach requires a trade-off between equivariance and symmetry breaking, which can limit its applicability in certain tasks. They also mention that further research is needed to better understand the theoretical foundations of their approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github repository is provided in the paper.</p>
