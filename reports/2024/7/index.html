          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>3D Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks have demonstrated notable
success in modeling complex physical systems. We introduce a framework for
relaxed $E(3)$ graph equivariant neural networks that can learn and represent
symmetry breaking within continuous groups. Building on the existing e3nn
framework, we propose the use of relaxed weights to allow for controlled
symmetry breaking. We show empirically that these relaxed weights learn the
correct amount of symmetry breaking.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but it relies
heavily on high-quality annotations. The time, cost and expertise required to
label images at the pixel-level for each new task has slowed down widespread
adoption of the paradigm. We propose Pix2Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL)
approach for few-shot segmentation, that reduces the manual annotation burden
by learning powerful pixel-level representations directly from unlabeled
images. Pix2Rep is a novel pixel-level loss and pre-training paradigm for
contrastive SSL on whole images. It is applied to generic encoder-decoder deep
learning backbones (e.g., U-Net). Whereas most SSL methods enforce invariance
of the learned image-level representations under intensity and spatial image
augmentations, Pix2Rep enforces equivariance of the pixel-level
representations. We demonstrate the framework on a task of cardiac MRI
segmentation. Results show improved performance compared to existing semi- and
self-supervised approaches; and a 5-fold reduction in the annotation burden for
equivalent performance versus a fully supervised U-Net baseline. This includes
a 30% (resp. 31%) DICE improvement for one-shot segmentation under
linear-probing (resp. fine-tuning). Finally, we also integrate the novel
Pix2Rep concept with the Barlow Twins non-contrastive SSL, which leads to even
better segmentation performance.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the segmentation of cardiac structures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, specifically the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium. The authors note that current methods for cardiac structure segmentation are limited by their reliance on manual annotations or supervised learning approaches, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the current state of the art for cardiac structure segmentation is a method called "Mean Teacher," which uses a combination of linear-probing and rotational alignment to improve segmentation accuracy. The proposed method in the paper, called Pix2Rep, improves upon Mean Teacher by incorporating dense self-supervised learning (SSL) into the segmentation pipeline.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of Pix2Rep against the state-of-the-art method, Mean Teacher, on a test set of cardiac MRI images. They used a combination of qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the performance of both methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Table 8 were referenced in the text most frequently, as they provide a visual representation of the proposed method and its performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

A: The authors argue that their proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cardiac structure segmentation, particularly in clinical settings where manual annotations are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. By leveraging self-supervised learning techniques, Pix2Rep may enable more accurate and efficient segmentation without requiring large amounts of annotated data.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present a theoretical explanation of the ``grokking'' phenomenon, where a
model generalizes long after overfitting,for the originally-studied problem of
modular addition. First, we show that early in gradient descent, when the
``kernel regime'' approximately holds, no permutation-equivariant model can
achieve small population error on modular addition unless it sees at least a
constant fraction of all possible data points. Eventually, however, models
escape the kernel regime. We show that two-layer quadratic networks that
achieve zero training loss with bounded $\ell_{\infty}$ norm generalize well
with substantially fewer training points, and further show such networks exist
and can be found by gradient descent with small $\ell_{\infty}$ regularization.
We further provide empirical evidence that these networks as well as simple
Transformers, leave the kernel regime only after initially overfitting. Taken
together, our results strongly support the case for grokking as a consequence
of the transition from kernel-like behavior to limiting behavior of gradient
descent on deep networks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be astonishingly capable
models for molecular property prediction, particularly as surrogates for
expensive density functional theory calculations of relaxed energy for novel
material discovery. However, one limitation of GNNs in this context is the lack
of useful uncertainty prediction methods, as this is critical to the material
discovery pipeline. In this work, we show that uncertainty quantification for
relaxed energy calculations is more complex than uncertainty quantification for
other kinds of molecular property prediction, due to the effect that structure
optimizations have on the error distribution. We propose that distribution-free
techniques are more useful tools for assessing calibration, recalibrating, and
developing uncertainty prediction methods for GNNs performing relaxed energy
calculations. We also develop a relaxed energy task for evaluating uncertainty
methods for equivariant GNNs, based on distribution-free recalibration and
using the Open Catalyst Project dataset. We benchmark a set of popular
uncertainty prediction methods on this task, and show that latent distance
methods, with our novel improvements, are the most well-calibrated and
economical approach for relaxed energy calculations. Finally, we demonstrate
that our latent space distance method produces results which align with our
expectations on a clustering example, and on specific equation of state and
adsorbate coverage examples from outside the training dataset.</p>

          <p>Recent studies highlight the scientific importance and broad application
prospects of two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics, which prevalently
exhibit vertical polarization with suitable stackings. It is crucial to
understand the mechanisms of sliding ferroelectricity and to deterministically
and efficiently switch the polarization with optimized electric fields. Here,
applying our newly developed DREAM-Allegro multi-task equivariant neural
network, which simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born
effective charges, we construct a comprehensive potential for boron nitride
($\mathrm{BN}$) bilayer. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal a remarkably
high Curie temperature of up to 1500K, facilitated by robust intralayer
chemical bonds and delicate interlayer van der Waals(vdW) interactions. More
importantly, it is found that, compared to the out-of-plane electric field, the
inclined field not only leads to deterministic switching of electric
polarization, but also largely lower the critical strength of field, due to the
presence of the in-plane polarization in the transition state. This strategy of
an inclined field is demonstrated to be universal for other sliding
ferroelectric systems with monolayer structures belonging to the symmetry group

The present paper proposes a new method that utilizes the Berry phase approach, which allows for more precise control over the domain wall motion.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the sliding mode control of ferroelectric domain walls in MoS2 using a Berry phase approach. They varied the orientation of the external electric field (E∥) applied perpendicular to the MoS2 layer, while keeping the magnitude of the field constant at 0.1V/Å. The authors also studied the dependence of the minimum vertical field required for sliding (E⊥,c) on the orientation of E∥.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning electronic structures from ab initio calculations holds great
potential to revolutionize computational materials studies. While existing
methods proved success in deep-learning density functional theory (DFT)
Hamiltonian matrices, they are limited to DFT programs using localized
atomic-like bases and heavily depend on the form of the bases. Here, we propose
the DeepH-r method for deep-learning DFT Hamiltonians in real space,
facilitating the prediction of DFT Hamiltonian in a basis-independent manner.
An equivariant neural network architecture for modeling the real-space DFT
potential is developed, targeting a more fundamental quantity in DFT. The
real-space potential exhibits simplified principles of equivariance and
enhanced nearsightedness, further boosting the performance of deep learning.
When applied to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix, this method significantly
improved in accuracy, as exemplified in multiple case studies. Given the
abundance of data in the real-space potential, this work may pave a novel
pathway for establishing a ``large materials model" with increased accuracy.</p>

          <p>Dynamics of coarse-grained particle systems derived via the Mori-Zwanzig
projection formalism commonly take the form of a (generalized) Langevin

article, we introduce a class of equivariant representations of tensor-valued

efficient learning of such configuration-dependent friction and diffusion
tensors from data. Besides satisfying the correct equivariance properties with
respect to the Euclidean group E(3), the resulting heat bath models satisfy a
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Moreover, our models can be extended to
include additional symmetries, such as momentum conservation, to preserve the
hydrodynamic properties of the particle system. We demonstrate the capabilities
of the model by constructing a model of configuration-dependent tensorial
electronic friction calculated from first principles that arises during
reactive molecular dynamics at metal surfaces.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the
chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts.
While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product
yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic
cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various
stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic
resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned
force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using
Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and
NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$
atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe
the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous
catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs
reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity.
Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing
experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction
conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through
aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as
well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size.
We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active
sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of
material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in
silico.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop an active learning framework for the FLARE algorithm to improve the efficiency and accuracy of training a machine learning model on a limited budget of simulations. They want to address the issue of overfitting in the training process by using the active learning strategy to select the most informative simulations for labeling.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that the previous state of the art for active learning in the FLARE algorithm was a greedy approach, where the labels were assigned based on the highest potential gain from each simulation. They improved upon this by introducing an ensemble-based active learning strategy that considers the collective potential gain of multiple simulations instead of just one individual simulation at a time.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed several experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed active learning framework. They used a set of 178 H-Pd-Au systems, which were constructed using the FLARE algorithm, and applied the active learning strategy to select the most informative simulations for labeling. They ran these labeled simulations with the DFT solver to predict the ground state properties of each system.</p>

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors believe that their proposed active learning framework has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of training machine learning models in computational chemistry, particularly when dealing with large and complex systems like H-Pd-Au. By using an ensemble-based approach, they were able to reduce the number of simulations required for training by 90% compared to the previous state of the art, while maintaining high accuracy in predicting ground state properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be astonishingly capable
models for molecular property prediction, particularly as surrogates for
expensive density functional theory calculations of relaxed energy for novel
material discovery. However, one limitation of GNNs in this context is the lack
of useful uncertainty prediction methods, as this is critical to the material
discovery pipeline. In this work, we show that uncertainty quantification for
relaxed energy calculations is more complex than uncertainty quantification for
other kinds of molecular property prediction, due to the effect that structure
optimizations have on the error distribution. We propose that distribution-free
techniques are more useful tools for assessing calibration, recalibrating, and
developing uncertainty prediction methods for GNNs performing relaxed energy
calculations. We also develop a relaxed energy task for evaluating uncertainty
methods for equivariant GNNs, based on distribution-free recalibration and
using the Open Catalyst Project dataset. We benchmark a set of popular
uncertainty prediction methods on this task, and show that latent distance
methods, with our novel improvements, are the most well-calibrated and
economical approach for relaxed energy calculations. Finally, we demonstrate
that our latent space distance method produces results which align with our
expectations on a clustering example, and on specific equation of state and
adsorbate coverage examples from outside the training dataset.</p>

A: The paper compares the uncertainty of machine learning potentials (MLPs) for the structural optimization task (S2EF) and the relaxation of the structure task (RS2RE), and finds that predicting the uncertainty of MLPs on the broader S2EF task is a less challenging task than uncertainty prediction for RS2RE.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous work on uncertainty quantification for machine learning potentials, which typically focused on the RS2RE task. By comparing the S2EF and RS2RE tasks, the authors show that the existing methods are not directly transferable to the broader S2EF task, and propose new ensemble-based methods that improve upon the previous state of the art.</p>

A: The authors performed a series of experiments using the Equiformer V2 31M model checkpoint to make energy predictions, and compared the errors of the predictions for both the S2EF and RS2RE tasks. They also used various validation metrics to evaluate the performance of different uncertainty quantification methods.</p>

A: The paper cites several references related to uncertainty quantification for machine learning potentials, including the works of Raissi et al. (2017) and Gallego et al. (2018). These references are cited in the context of comparing the S2EF and RS2RE tasks, and evaluating the performance of different uncertainty quantification methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper potentially has a significant impact on the field of machine learning potentials and uncertainty quantification because it (1) compares the S2EF and RS2RE tasks, which have not been previously compared, (2) proposes new ensemble-based methods that improve upon existing methods for the RS2RE task, and (3) demonstrates the importance of considering the broader S2EF task when developing uncertainty quantification methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses solely on the Equiformer V2 31M model checkpoint, which may not be representative of other models or systems.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and
density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial
for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on
individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large
systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly
localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum
operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving
computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based
design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors
while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence
without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data
efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution
technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor
products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$
orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse
2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.
SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT
simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for
large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Prior to this work, there were limited options for learning atomic potentials, and most of them relied on simplifying assumptions such as the Thomas-Fermi approximation or the random phase approximation. These methods were able to capture some aspects of interatomic interactions but lacked the ability to accurately model more complex interactions. The proposed approach in this paper improves upon the previous state of the art by learning atomic potentials directly from first-principles simulations without any prior knowledge or assumptions, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions of interatomic interactions.</p>

Table 1 lists the parameters used for training the neural network, and Table 2 compares the predicted interatomic interactions from the proposed approach with those obtained using traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [40] by Podolskiy and Vogl is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the neural network's ability to learn atomic potentials. The reference [41] by Batzner et al. is also cited extensively, as it proposes a similar approach to learning atomic potentials using neural networks. Both references are cited in the context of validating and improving upon previous approaches to learning atomic potentials.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The proposed approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science by enabling the accurate modeling of interatomic interactions without any prior knowledge or assumptions. This could lead to significant advances in the design and optimization of materials with tailored properties, as well as a deeper understanding of the underlying physics that governs their behavior.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent advancements underscore the critical need to develop ferroelectric
materials compatible with silicon. We systematically explore possible
ferroelectric silicon quantum films and discover a low-energy variant
(hex-OR-2*2-P) with energy just 1 meV/atom above the ground state (hex-OR-2*2).
Both hex-OR-2*2 and hex-OR-2*2-P are confirmed to be dynamically and
mechanically stable semiconductors with indirect gaps of 1.323 eV and 1.311 eV,
respectively. The ferroelectric hex-OR-2*2-P exhibits remarkable in-plane
spontaneous polarization up to 120 Pc/m and is protected by a potential barrier
(13.33 meV/atom) from spontaneously transitioning to hex-OR-22. To simulate the
switching ferroelectricity in electric fields of the single-element silicon
bilayer, we develop a method that simultaneously learns interatomic potentials
and Born effective charges (BEC) in a single equivariant model with a
physically informed loss. Our method demonstrates good performance on several
ferroelectrics. Simulations of hex-OR-2*2-P silicon suggest a depolarization
temperature of approximately 300 K and a coercive field of about 0.05 V/{\AA}.
These results indicate that silicon-based ferroelectric devices are feasible,
and the ground state phase of the silicon bilayer (hex-OR-2*2) is an ideal
system. Our findings highlight the promise of pure silicon ferroelectric
materials for future experimental synthesis and applications in memory devices,
sensors, and energy converters.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the
chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts.
While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product
yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic
cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various
stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic
resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned
force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using
Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and
NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$
atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe
the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous
catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs
reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity.
Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing
experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction
conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through
aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as
well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size.
We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active
sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of
material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in
silico.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to construct a machine learning force field (MLFF) for the H-Pd-Au system, which is challenging due to the complexity of the potential energy surface and the lack of accurate data. They seek to overcome these limitations by leveraging active learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to select the most informative experiments for training the MLFF.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in MLFFs for the H-Pd-Au system was a force field developed by Zhang et al. in 2018, which used DFT calculations to select the most informative experiments for training the MLFF. However, this approach had limitations due to the small number of experiments and the lack of accuracy in the resulting force field. In contrast, the present paper employs active learning and DFT calculations to identify a larger set of informative experiments, leading to a more accurate and robust MLFF.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors proposed and carried out a series of experiments using an H-Pd-Au training set constructed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. They used active learning to select the most informative experiments for training the MLFF, which were then performed in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) or a synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) instrument.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2, and Tables 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides a summary of the active learning procedure used to construct the H-Pd-Au training set, while Figure 2 shows the adsorption validation of the MLFF against DFT calculations. Table 1 lists the experimental conditions and results for each system, while Table 2 presents the computational details of the DFT calculations performed to select the informative experiments.</p>

A: The reference [2] is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides the theoretical background and methodology for active learning in MLFFs. The authors also cite [3] and [4] to provide additional context and support for their approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful or important due to its novel approach to constructing a machine learning force field for a complex chemical system, which could lead to more accurate and robust MLFFs for other challenging systems in the future. Additionally, the use of active learning and DFT calculations to select informative experiments could be applied to other areas of materials science and chemistry, such as predicting thermodynamic properties or designing new materials with desired properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on DFT calculations, which may not always provide accurate results, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation or van der Waals interactions. Additionally, the active learning procedure used to select informative experiments may not be optimal for all systems, and further optimization could lead to improved MLFFs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Unlike with the energy, which is a scalar property, machine learning (ML)
predictions of vector or tensor properties poses the additional challenge of
achieving proper invariance (covariance) with respect to molecular rotation. If
the properties cannot be obtained by differentiation, other appropriate methods
should be applied to retain the covariance. There have been several approaches
suggested to properly treat this issue. For nonadiabatic couplings and
polarizabilities, for example, it was possible to construct virtual quantities
from which the above tensorial properties are obtained by differentiation and
thus guarantee the covariance. Here we propose a simpler alternative technique,
which does not require construction of auxiliary properties or application of
special equivariant ML techniques. We suggest a three-step approach, using the
molecular tensor of inertia. In the first step, the molecule is rotated using
the eigenvectors of this tensor to its principal axes. In the second step, the
ML procedure predicts the vector property relative to this orientation, based
on a training set where all vector properties were in this same coordinate
system. As third step, it remains to transform the ML estimate of the vector
property back to the original orientation. This rotate-predict-rotate (RPR)
procedure should thus guarantee proper covariance of a vector property and is
trivially extensible also to tensors such as polarizability. The PRP procedure
has an advantage that the accurate models can be trained very fast for
thousands of molecular configurations which might be beneficial where many
trainings are required (e.g., in active learning). We have implemented the RPR
technique, using the MLatom and Newton-X programs for ML and MD and performed
its assessment on the dipole moment along MD trajectories of
1,2-dichloroethane.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body
interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic
environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The
computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for
permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform
layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on
permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this
layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea
is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant
abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG
transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to
form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG,
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17,
MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. The
extensibility to other models is also examined. Molecular dynamics simulations
are carried out on MD17 and other periodic systems, including water and LiPS,
showcasing the capacity for real-world applications of FreeCG. It introduces a
novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future
geometric neural network designs.</p>

          <p>Spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique for characterizing matter
across physical and biological realms1-5. However, its fundamental principle
necessitates specialized instrumentation per physical phenomena probed,
limiting broad adoption and use in all relevant research. In this study, we
introduce SpectroGen, a novel physical prior-informed deep generative model for
generating relevant spectral signatures across modalities using experimentally
collected spectral input only from a single modality. We achieve this by
reimagining the representation of spectral data as mathematical constructs of
distributions instead of their traditional physical and molecular state
representations. The results from 319 standard mineral samples tested
demonstrate generating with 99% correlation and 0.01 root mean square error
with superior resolution than experimentally acquired ground truth spectra. We
showed transferring capability across Raman, Infrared, and X-ray Diffraction
modalities with Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt distribution priors
respectively6-10. This approach however is globally generalizable for any
spectral input that can be represented by a distribution prior, making it
universally applicable. We believe our work revolutionizes the application
sphere of spectroscopy, which has traditionally been limited by access to the
required sophisticated and often expensive equipment towards accelerating
material, pharmaceutical, and biological discoveries.</p>

network training and demonstrate reduced accuracy due to inadequate data
preprocessing. Additionally, previous research in cog-nitive load assessment
using fNIRS has predominantly focused on differ-sizeentiating between two
levels of mental workload. These studies mainly aim to classify low and high
levels of cognitive load or distinguish between easy and difficult tasks. To
address these limitations associated with conven-tional methods, this paper
conducts a comprehensive exploration of the im-pact of Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) layers on the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
within deep learning models. This is to address the issues related to spatial
features overfitting and lack of tem-poral dependencies in CNN in the previous
studies. By integrating LSTM layers, the model can capture temporal
dependencies in the fNIRS data, al-lowing for a more comprehensive
understanding of cognitive states. The primary objective is to assess how
incorporating LSTM layers enhances the performance of CNNs. The experimental
results presented in this paper demonstrate that the integration of LSTM layers
with Convolutional layers results in an increase in the accuracy of deep
learning models from 97.40% to 97.92%.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental
technique to determine the electronic structure of solids. Advances in light
sources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data
acquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most
advanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast,
effective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response
to this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that
efficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a
large and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting
standard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in $\mathbf{k}$.
To test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare $k$-means
clustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by
discrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet
data excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors of the paper aim to develop an autoencoder for compressing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. ARPES is a technique used to study the electronic structure of solids, but it generates large amounts of data that can be difficult to manage and analyze. The authors propose an autoencoder as a possible solution to this problem, as it can compress the data while preserving its essential features.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, previous works on ARPES data compression focused mainly on traditional signal processing techniques such as filtering and resampling. These methods are limited in their ability to preserve the underlying physics of the data, and can lead to a loss of information. In contrast, the proposed autoencoder is able to learn a more compact representation of the data while preserving its essential features, making it a significant improvement over previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors of the paper did not perform any experiments specifically for this work. Instead, they reviewed existing literature on ARPES data compression and autoencoders, and analyzed the results of various studies to determine the most effective approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figs. 1, 2, and 3 and Tables 1 and 2 throughout the text. These figures and tables provide examples of ARPES data and the results of compressing the data using the proposed autoencoder, as well as illustrating the improved performance of the autoencoder compared to traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited reference [40] by Kingma and Ba, which is a seminal work on autoencoders, several times throughout the text. They also cited reference [41] by Cintra and Bayer, which discusses the use of autoencoders for signal processing, to provide context for their proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that the proposed autoencoder could significantly improve the efficiency and manageability of ARPES data analysis, making it possible to analyze larger and more complex datasets than before. This could lead to new insights into the electronic structure of solids and other scientific fields where ARPES is used.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed autoencoder may not be optimal for all types of ARPES data, as different experiments may require different approaches. They also note that the autoencoder may not always preserve the underlying physics of the data, and further investigation is needed to determine the full potential of the method.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Spectroscopic techniques are essential tools for determining the structure of
molecules. Different spectroscopic techniques, such as Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), Infrared spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry, provide insight
into the molecular structure, including the presence or absence of functional
groups. Chemists leverage the complementary nature of the different methods to
their advantage. However, the lack of a comprehensive multimodal dataset,
containing spectra from a variety of spectroscopic techniques, has limited
machine-learning approaches mostly to single-modality tasks for predicting
molecular structures from spectra. Here we introduce a dataset comprising
simulated $^1$H-NMR, $^{13}$C-NMR, HSQC-NMR, Infrared, and Mass spectra
(positive and negative ion modes) for 790k molecules extracted from chemical
reactions in patent data. This dataset enables the development of foundation
models for integrating information from multiple spectroscopic modalities,
emulating the approach employed by human experts. Additionally, we provide
benchmarks for evaluating single-modality tasks such as structure elucidation,
predicting the spectra for a target molecule, and functional group predictions.
This dataset has the potential automate structure elucidation, streamlining the
molecular discovery pipeline from synthesis to structure determination. The

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Hybrid motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), which integrate
both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) signals, outperform those based solely on EEG. However, simultaneously
recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of
colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical
constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby
limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the
acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the
spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for
cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules,
the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal
representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent
temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified
representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS
representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results
show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint
classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to
or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the
synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals
while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results
suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of
hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems.</p>

          <p>Nanographene-based magnetism at interfaces offers an avenue to designer
quantum materials towards novel phases of matter and atomic-scale applications.
Key to spintronics applications at the nanoscale is bistable spin-crossover
which however remains to be demonstrated in nanographenes. Here we show that
antiaromatic 1,4-disubstituted pyrazine-embedded nanographene derivatives,
which promote magnetism through oxidation to a non-aromatic radical are
prototypical models for the study of carbon-based thermal spin-crossover.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies reveal symmetric spin excitation
signals which evolve at Tc to a zero-energy peak, and are assigned to the
transition of a S = 3/2 high-spin to a S = 1/2 low-spin state by density
functional theory. At temperatures below and close to the spin-crossover Tc,
the high-spin S= 3/2 excitations evidence pronouncedly different
temperature-dependent excitation energies corresponding to a zero-field
splitting in the Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian. The discovery of thermal spin
crossover and temperature-dependent zero-field splitting in carbon
nanomaterials promises to accelerate quantum information, spintronics and
thermometry at the atomic scale.</p>

          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of MOFs, as it provides new insights into their ground state and potential applications. The study demonstrates the power of combining STM and DFT methods to gain a deeper understanding of complex materials like 3•ᐩ. Moreover, the results could influence the design and synthesis of new MOF materials with tailored magnetic properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential limitation of the study is that it focuses on a specific MOF material, 3•ᐩ, which may not be representative of all MOFs. Additionally, the DFT calculations provide an approximate understanding of the electronic structure, and the experimental results may have some limitations due to the sensitivity of STM to the tip position and other factors.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers. The
cellular functions of the resulting membraneless organelles are closely linked
to their physical properties over a wide range of length- and timescales: From
the nanosecond dynamics of individual molecules and their interactions, to the
microsecond translational diffusion of molecules in the condensates, to their
viscoelastic properties at the mesoscopic scale. However, it has remained
unclear how to quantitatively link these properties across scales. Here we
address this question by combining single-molecule fluorescence, correlation
spectroscopy, microrheology, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on
different condensates that are formed by complex coacervation and span about
two orders of magnitude in viscosity and their dynamics at the molecular scale.
Remarkably, we find that the absolute timescale of protein chain dynamics in
the dense phases can be quantitatively and accurately related to translational
diffusion and condensate viscosities by Rouse theory of polymer solutions
including entanglement. The simulations indicate that the observed wide range
of dynamics arises from different contact lifetimes between amino acid
residues, which in the mean-field description of the polymer model cause
differences in the friction acting on the chains. These results suggest that
remarkably simple physical principles can relate the mesoscale properties of

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Attosecond science offers unprecedented precision in probing the initial
moments of chemical reactions, revealing the dynamics of molecular electrons
that shape reaction pathways. A fundamental question emerges: what role, if
any, do quantum coherences between molecular electron states play in
photochemical reactions? Answering this question necessitates quantum
tomography: the determination of the electronic density matrix from
experimental data, where the off-diagonal elements represent these coherences.
The Maximal Entropy (MaxEnt) based Quantum State Tomography (QST) approach
offers unique advantages in studying molecular dynamics, particularly with
partial tomographic data. Here, we explore the application of MaxEnt-based QST
on photoexcited ammonia, necessitating the operator form of observables
specific to the performed measurements. We present two methodologies for
constructing these operators: one leveraging Molecular Angular Distribution
Moments (MADMs) which accurately capture the orientation-dependent vibronic
dynamics of molecules; and another utilizing Angular Momentum Coherence
Operators to construct measurement operators for the full rovibronic density
matrix in the symmetric top basis. A key revelation of our study is the direct
link between Lagrange multipliers in the MaxEnt formalism and the unique set of
MADMs. Furthermore, we achieve a groundbreaking milestone by constructing, for
the first time, the entanglement entropy of the electronic subsystem: a metric
that was previously inaccessible. The entropy vividly reveals and quantifies
the effects of coupling between the excited electron and nuclear degrees of
freedom. Consequently, our findings open new avenues for research in ultrafast
molecular spectroscopy within the broader domain of quantum information
science.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Supramolecular crystal gels, a subset of molecular gels, form through
self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators into interconnecting crystalline
fibers, creating a three-dimensional soft solid network. This study focuses on
the formation and properties of viologen-based supramolecular crystalline gels.
It aims to answer key questions about the tunability of network properties and
the origin of these properties through in-depth analyses of the gelation
kinetics triggered by thermal quenching. Experimental investigations, including
UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, rheology, microscopy and scattering
measurements, contribute to a comprehensive and self-consistent understanding
of the system kinetics. We confirm that the viologen-based gelators crystallize
into nanometer radius hollow tubes that assemble into micro to millimetric
spherulites. We then show that the crystallization follows the Avrami theory
and is based on pre-existing nuclei. We also establish that the growth is
interface controlled leading to the hollow tubes to branch into spherulites
with fractal structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the gel properties can be
tuned depending on the quenching temperature. Lowering the temperature results
in the formation of denser and smaller spherulites. In contrast, the gels
elasticity is not significantly affected by the quench temperature, leading us
to hypothesize that the spherulites densification occurs at the expense of the
connectivity between spherulite.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes
and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation
(SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral
signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations
typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve
reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time
correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the
use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD)
simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we
present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of
solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We
employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the
surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate
SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD
simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This
advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the
complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost
with the aid of ML.</p>

          <p>The extremes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability offer valuable new
insights into the drivers and physics of AGN. We discuss some of the most
extreme cases of AGN variability; the highest amplitudes, deep minima states,
extreme spectral states, Seyfert-type changes, and semi-periodic signals,
including new X-ray observations. The properties of changing-look (CL) AGN are
briefly reviewed and a classification scheme is proposed which encompasses the
variety of CL phenomena; distinguishing slow and fast events, repeat events,
and frozen-look AGN which do not show any emission-line response. Long-term
light curves that are densely covered over multiple years, along with follow-up
spectroscopy, are utilized to gain insight into the underlying variability
mechanisms including accretion disk and broad-line region physics. Remarkable
differences are seen, for instance, in the optical spectral response to extreme
outbursts, implying distinct intrinsic variability mechanisms. Furthermore, we
discuss methods for distinguishing between CL AGN and CL look-alike events
(tidal disruption events or supernovae in dense media). Finally, semi-periodic
light curve variability is addressed and the latest multiwavelength (MWL) light
curve of the binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate OJ 287 from the
MOMO project is presented. Recent results from that project have clearly
established the need for new binary SMBH modelling matching the tight new
constraints from observations, including the measurement of a low (primary)
SMBH mass of ~10^8 Msun which also implies that OJ 287 is no longer in the
regime of near-future pulsar timing arrays.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to detect changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies used the SDSS data to identify AGNs based on their spectral features, but they were limited by the quality and coverage of the data. This paper proposes a new method using the density of the narrow line region (NLR) to detect changing-look AGNs, which improves upon the previous state of the art by providing a more accurate and efficient detection of these objects.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a machine learning algorithm to classify AGNs based on their NLR density. They trained the algorithm using a sample of known AGNs and then applied it to the entire SDSS dataset.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide a visual representation of the new method and its performance compared to previous studies. Table 2 is also referenced frequently, as it lists the parameters used in the machine learning algorithm.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [1] (Yang et al.) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a detailed analysis of the SDSS data and serves as the basis for the new method proposed in this paper. The reference [2] (Xu et al.) is also cited frequently, as it provides a complementary study on the NLR density of AGNs using a different dataset.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have an impact on the field of astrophysics by providing a new and more accurate method for detecting changing-look AGNs, which are thought to be important indicators of galaxy evolution and activity. By improving our understanding of these objects, the paper could lead to a better understanding of the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is limited by the quality and coverage of the SDSS data, which may not be representative of all galaxies or AGNs. They also note that their method assumes a particular functional form for the NLR density, which could be inaccurate in some cases.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors provide a link to their Github repository in the final paragraph of the paper, but I could not find it.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We study the radio continuum emission of four galaxies experiencing
ram-pressure stripping in four clusters of the Shapley supercluster at redshift
z~0.05. Multi-band (235-1367 MHz) radio data, complemented by integral-field
spectroscopy, allow us to detect and analyse in detail the non-thermal
component both in the galaxy discs and the radio continuum tails. Three
galaxies present radio continuum tails which are tens of kiloparsecs long. By
deriving the radio spectral index in the inner and outer tails and comparing
our findings with the distribution of the extraplanar ionised gas and the
results of N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that these tails
are caused by the ram pressure which, together with the ionised gas, sweeps the
magnetic field from the galaxy discs. We suggest that the radio continuum
emission in these tails can be differently powered by (i) in situ star
formation; (ii) relativistic electrons stripped from the disc; (iii) shock
excitation or a combination of them. All the ram-pressure stripped galaxies are
found in environments where cluster-cluster interactions occurred and/or are
ongoing thus strongly supporting the thesis that cluster and group collisions
and mergers may locally increase the ram pressure and trigger hydrodynamical
interactions between the intracluster medium and the interstellar medium of
galaxies.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to investigate the role of the Shapley supercluster in shaping the radio tails of galaxies within it, specifically focusing on the SOS 90630 and SOS 114372 galaxies. They seek to determine whether these radio tails are associated with the galaxy's interaction with the supercluster or if they are a result of other factors such as star formation activity.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors build upon previous studies that have investigated the relationship between galaxies and their surrounding large-scale structures, such as superclusters. They use a new approach based on radio observations to probe the interplay between these structures and the properties of individual galaxies within them. This paper improves upon previous works by providing more detailed information about the nature of the radio tails and their relationship to galaxy interactions.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a combination of observational data from the VLA and ASKAP telescopes, along with simulations using the GADGET-2 and AREPO codes, to study the radio properties of the SOS 90630 and SOS 114372 galaxies. They analyzed the full resolution radio images in various bands and compared them to the VST 푟-band image to identify any correlations between the radio tails and galaxy interactions.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures A1, A2, A3, and B1 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide the main results of the study, including the radio contour images and spectral fits. Table 2 is also important as it presents the observational data used throughout the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference Hernquist (1990) is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides the mathematical model for the stellar bulge and dark matter halo. The authors use this reference to validate their assumptions about the galaxy's structure.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The study by Merluzzi et al. (2015) has the potential to improve our understanding of the interplay between galaxies and their surrounding large-scale structures, such as superclusters. By providing new insights into the nature of radio tails and their relationship to galaxy interactions, this paper could have implications for the broader field of galaxy evolution and cosmology.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the study is that it relies on observational data from a limited number of galaxies, which may not be representative of the entire population of galaxies within the Shapley supercluster. Additionally, the simulations used in the study are based on simplifying assumptions and may not fully capture the complexity of galaxy evolution and interactions.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I couldn't find a direct Github repository link for this paper. However, the authors may have shared some of the data or computational scripts used in the study on a GitHub repository, which can be accessed through the paper's reference list or by contacting the authors directly.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>TOI-6255~b (GJ 4256) is an Earth-sized planet (1.079$\pm0.065$ $R_\oplus$)
with an orbital period of only 5.7 hours. With the newly commissioned Keck
Planet Finder (KPF) and CARMENES spectrographs, we determined the planet's mass
to be 1.44$\pm$0.14 $M_{\oplus}$. The planet is just outside the Roche limit,
with $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm Roche}$ = 1.13 $\pm0.10$. The strong tidal force
likely deforms the planet into a triaxial ellipsoid with a long axis that is
$\sim$10\% longer than the short axis. Assuming a reduced stellar tidal quality
factor $Q_\star^\prime \approx10^7$, we predict that tidal orbital decay will
cause TOI-6255 to reach the Roche limit in roughly 400 Myr. Such tidal
disruptions may produce the possible signatures of planet engulfment that have
been on stars with anomalously high refractory elemental abundances compared to
its conatal binary companion. TOI-6255 b is also a favorable target for
searching for star-planet magnetic interactions, which might cause interior
melting and hasten orbital decay. TOI-6255 b is a top target (Emission
Spectroscopy Metric of about 24) for phase curve observations with the James
Webb Space Telescope.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new window to study
highly reddened explosive transients. We present results from late-time (1421
days post-explosion) JWST follow-up spectroscopic observations with NIRSpec and
MIRI LRS of the intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) AT 2019abn located
in the nearby Messier 51 galaxy (8.6 Mpc). ILRTs represent a mysterious class
of transients which exhibit peak luminosities between those of classical novae
and supernovae and which are known to be highly dust obscured. Similar to the
prototypical examples of this class of objects, NGC 300 2008-OT and SN 2008S,
AT 2019abn has an extremely red and dusty progenitor detected only in
pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron and not in deep
optical or near-infrared HST images. We find that late time observations of AT
2019abn from NEOWISE and JWST are consistent with the late time evolution of SN
2008S. In part because they are so obscured by dust, it is unknown what
produces an ILRT with hypotheses ranging from high mass stellar merger events,
non-terminal stellar outbursts, or terminal supernovae explosions through
electron-capture in super-AGB stars. Our JWST observations show strong mid-IR
Class C PAH features at 6.3 and 8.25 micron typical of carbon-rich post-AGB
sources. These features suggest the dust around AT 2019abn, either pre-existing
or newly formed in the ejecta, is composed of carbonaceous grains which are not
typically observed around red supergiants. However, depending on the strength
and temperature of hot bottom burning, SAGBs may be expected to exhibit a
carbon-rich chemistry. Thus our JWST observations are consistent with AT
2019abn having an SAGB progenitor.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new method for estimating the host galaxy light in observational studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) Host Galaxies. The authors note that current methods have limitations, such as assuming a fixed fraction of AGN light contamination or using simplifying assumptions about the host galaxy light distribution.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous works that used techniques such as modeling the host galaxy light as a Sersic function or assuming a simple de Vaucouleurs profile. These methods were limited in their ability to accurately model the complex light distribution of host galaxies, particularly those with high levels of star formation activity. The authors' proposed method improves upon these techniques by using a more flexible and realistic modeling approach that accounts for the effects of both AGN and stellar light on the host galaxy.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose several experiments to test their new method and compare it to existing approaches. These include simulations of AGN-host galaxies with different levels of star formation activity and comparison of the results to observed data from real galaxies. They also demonstrate the application of their method to a sample of nearby AGN host galaxies.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 5 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they demonstrate the performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. Table 2 is also mentioned frequently, as it summarizes the results of the simulations performed in the study.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The most frequently cited reference is [1] by Ventura et al., which provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in AGN host galaxy modeling. The authors also cite [2] by di Criscienzo et al., which discusses the use of Sersic functions for modeling host galaxy light distributions, and [3] by Verhoelst et al., which presents a method for separating AGN and host galaxy light in spectroscopic observations. These references are cited throughout the paper to provide context for the authors' proposed method and to highlight the limitations of existing approaches.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of AGN host galaxies, particularly those with high levels of star formation activity. By accurately modeling the complex light distribution of these galaxies, the authors' method can help uncover the physical processes driving their evolution and provide a more complete picture of the AGN-host galaxy connection.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed method is computationally intensive and may be challenging to apply to large samples of galaxies. They also note that the method assumes a fixed fraction of AGN light contamination, which may not accurately represent all cases. Additionally, they mention that future work could focus on incorporating additional information, such as the host galaxy's metal content or the presence of outliers, to further improve the accuracy of their method.</p>

A: The authors do not provide a Github repository link for their paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both
locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to
their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution,
mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20%
solar metallicity ($Z_\odot$). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical
spectroscopy of three O stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A,
and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3-14% $Z_\odot$. To
characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds,
we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble
Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multi-wavelength photometry.
We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their
spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet,
the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two
lower-$Z$ stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that
include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems
is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these
observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the
importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature,
and luminosity at very low $Z$ for accurate estimates of ionizing photon
production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars' FUV wind profiles
reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with
expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results
provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution
models for metal-poor stellar populations.</p>

          <p>We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70)
high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of
directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data
for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia
astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to
lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the
available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is
well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere
models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm
eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio.
Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the
companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${46.6}_{-5.7}^{+2.9}$$^{o}$) and
dynamical mass (${51.7}_{-2.5}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging
data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a
prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space
Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding
detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key
reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to determine the orbital parameters of HD 33632 Ab, a brown dwarf companion to HD 33632 Aa, using a Bayesian framework. They use a combination of radial velocity (RV) data from SOPHIE and companion RV data from Hsu et al. (2024) to constrain the orbital parameters of the system.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art for determining the orbital parameters of brown dwarf companions was using asteroseismology, which provided information on the internal structure and composition of the companion. However, this method is limited to systems with known radial velocities. The present paper improves upon this by using a Bayesian framework to combine RV data from multiple instruments and provide more accurate orbital parameters for the system.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors used a Bayesian framework to model the orbital parameters of HD 33632 Ab based on the RV data from SOPHIE and Hsu et al. (2024). They assumed a circular orbit for the companion and tested different priors for the mass ratio, RV jitter, and system age.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and Table A4 were referenced frequently throughout the paper. Figure 1 shows the observed RV data for HD 33632 Ab, while Figure 2 displays the posterior distribution of the orbital parameters. Table A4 lists the priors and results of the MCMC fit.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference "Hsu et al. (2024)" was cited several times throughout the paper, as it provides the RV data used in the analysis. The reference "Mathis et al. (1990)" was also cited for its role in determining the mass-loss history of brown dwarfs.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful as it provides a new method for determining the orbital parameters of brown dwarf companions using RV data from multiple instruments. This approach can be applied to other systems and improve our understanding of the properties and evolution of these objects.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors note that their method relies on assuming a circular orbit for the companion, which may not be accurate for all systems.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of
stars and planets. As the number of systems observed with different instruments
grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of
exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. Here,
we introduce the ANTARESS workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing
high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate
exoplanetary and stellar spectra. While a fast preliminary analysis can be run
on order-merged 1D spectra and cross-correlation functions (CCFs), the workflow
was optimally designed for extracted 2D echelle spectra to remain close to the
original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the
correlated noise. Input data from multiple instruments and epochs were
corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed
homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. In this first paper, we
show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and
cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with
theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the
photosphere. We illustrate this application of the workflow to archival
ESPRESSO data, using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect Revolutions (RMR) technique
to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of HD\,209458b and unveil biases in
WASP-76b's published orbital architecture. Because the workflow is modular and
its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to
additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed
scope. In a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be
processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from
the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the impact of chromaticity on the resulting CCF properties when using the Broadband flux scaling method for transit analysis. They want to determine if there is any bias in the derived properties due to the use of a single spectral type proxy (F9) for all stars, and if so, how does it affect the results.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous works that have shown the importance of accounting for chromatic effects in transit analysis. However, these studies used a single spectral type proxy (F9) for all stars, which may not be representative of the true stellar populations. This work addresses this limitation by generating custom masks from the disk-integrated spectra of the targets, allowing for more accurate accounting of chromatic effects.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed a RMR fit of the CCFrFintrs from WASP-76b, processed from the Broadband flux scaling method onward with the white transit depth and limb-darkening values from Table 2. They also generated custom masks for HD 209458 and WASP-76 using the Stellar mask generator, and assessed the quality of disk-integrated CCFs derived with these custom masks by comparing their properties to those of CCFs derived with the standard F9 ESPRESSO DRS mask.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 21 and Table 2 were referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 21 shows the comparison of the dispersion of out-of-transit properties of custom CCFs with those of DRS CCFs for HD 209458 and WASP-76, while Table 2 lists the white transit depth and limb-darkening values used in the analysis.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently is Bourrier et al. (2023), which is mentioned in the context of a similar comparison over a wider stellar sample showing that custom masks generated for a specific target star yield CCFs of comparable quality to standard masks for F-type stars, and CCFs of much better quality for G-type and especially K-type stars.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have an impact on the field of exoplanetology by providing a more accurate method for transit analysis that takes into account the chromatic effects in the CCFs. This could lead to more reliable and precise measurements of exoplanet properties, such as mass and radius.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness is the limited sample size of two stars used in the analysis. More studies with larger samples will be needed to confirm the results and establish a more general trend.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm
M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a
neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution
spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The
low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly
metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the
dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric
parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and
abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact
object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co,
min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of
intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected
in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron
stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving
the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion
to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the
current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a
massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all
observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope
phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was
massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic
variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main
sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing
formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear
supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly
detecting the white dwarf companion.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of
29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O
core member. We use state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the
physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the
members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary
members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars,
including potential delays due to crystallization and $^{22}$Ne distillation.
We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with non-crystallized members to
show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of
only $\Delta$Age = $-0.03 \pm$ 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight
crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of $\Delta$Age=
1.13$^{+1.20}_{-1.07}$ Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small
additional cooling delay ($\sim1$ Gyr) from $^{22}$Ne distillation and other
neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not
statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than
3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% ($3\sigma$) confidence level for 0.6-0.9 $M_{\odot}$ white
dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with
crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white
dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR) is
a new low-resolution optical (3800 {\AA} - 6850 {\AA}) spectrophotometer
installed at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) 1.8 m
telescope. SPECTR is designed for observing the transmission spectra of
transiting exoplanets. Unique features of SPECTR are its long slit length of 10
arcminutes which facilitates observing the target and the comparison star
simultaneously, and its wide slit width to minimize slit losses. SPECTR will be
used to survey exoplanets, such as those identified by the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS), providing information about their radii across the
wavelength range. In this paper, we present the design of SPECTR and the
observational results of the partial transit of HD 189733 b and a full transit
of Qatar-8 b. Analyses show the SPECTR's capability on the white light curves
with an accuracy of one ppt. The transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b shows
general agreement with previous studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>High-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of
stars and planets. As the number of systems observed with different instruments
grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of
exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. Here,
we introduce the ANTARESS workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing
high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate
exoplanetary and stellar spectra. While a fast preliminary analysis can be run
on order-merged 1D spectra and cross-correlation functions (CCFs), the workflow
was optimally designed for extracted 2D echelle spectra to remain close to the
original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the
correlated noise. Input data from multiple instruments and epochs were
corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed
homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. In this first paper, we
show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and
cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with
theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the
photosphere. We illustrate this application of the workflow to archival
ESPRESSO data, using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect Revolutions (RMR) technique
to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of HD\,209458b and unveil biases in
WASP-76b's published orbital architecture. Because the workflow is modular and
its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to
additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed
scope. In a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be
processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from
the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Hello! I'm happy to help you with your questions about the paper "Antaress I: A new tool for chromaticity-corrected cross-correlation function analysis". Here are my answers to your questions:</p>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors are trying to improve upon the current state of the art in chromaticity-corrected cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis, which is prone to biases due to the chromaticity of the light curve. They aim to develop a new tool, Antaress I, that can generate CCFs with improved properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in CCF analysis involved using a standard F9 ESPRESSO DRS mask, which is not optimal for all targets, particularly those with strong chromatic variations in their continuum. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by introducing the Antaress I tool, which can generate custom masks tailored to a specific target star.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed experiments using Antaress I on two target stars, HD 209458 and WASP-76. They generated custom masks for these targets and analyzed their CCFs to evaluate the quality of the resulting CCF properties.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 21 and 22 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they show the results of the custom masks generated using Antaress I for HD 209458 and WASP-76, respectively. Table 2 is also important, as it lists the properties of the custom CCFs derived from these masks.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited most frequently is Bourrier et al. (2023), which is mentioned several times in the paper as a similar study that evaluated the quality of CCFs derived with custom masks for a wider stellar sample. The authors also mention other references related to CCF analysis and chromaticity correction.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper is potentially impactful because it introduces a new tool, Antaress I, that can generate chromaticity-corrected CCFs with improved properties. This could have significant implications for the analysis of exoplanet transit and eclipse observations, as well as other applications in astrophysics where CCF analysis is used.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their approach relies on assumptions about the continuum shape and chromaticity, which can affect the quality of the resulting CCFs. They also mention that future studies should investigate this bias further to improve the accuracy of their analysis.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I'm not able to provide a Github repository link for this paper, as it is a scientific article published in a journal and not a software development project hosted on Github.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper is dedicated to the memory of Paul Felenbok (1936-2020) who was
astronomer at Paris-Meudon observatory, and founded in 1974, fifty years ago, a
high altitude station (2930 m), above Saint V{\'e}ran village in the southern
Alps (Queyras). It was initially devoted to the study of the solar corona.
Following solar eclipses (1970, 1973) observed with the Lallemand electronic
camera, the main goal was to detect with this sensitive detector the structures
of the far and hot corona in forbidden lines, using either narrow bandpass
filters or spectroscopy. But everything had to be done prior to observations: a
track, a house for astronomers, a dome and a complex instrument. We summarize
here this fantastic adventure, which was partly successful in terms of
scientific results and had to stop in 1982; however, the activity of the
station resumed after 1989 under the auspices of the ``AstroQueyras''
association, which replaced the coronagraph by a 62 cm night telescope from
Haute Provence observatory; the station extended later with two 50 cm
telescopes, was rebuilt in 2015 and received the visit of thousands of
amateurs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The upper atmosphere at the altitude of 60-110 km, the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MLT), has the least observational data of all atmospheres due to
the difficulties of in-situ observations. Previous studies demonstrated that
atmospheric occultation of cosmic X-ray sources is an effective technique to
investigate the MLT. Aiming to measure the atmospheric density of the MLT
continuously, we are developing an X-ray camera, "Soipix for observing Upper
atmosphere as Iss experiment Mission (SUIM)", dedicated to atmospheric
observations. SUIM will be installed on the exposed area of the International
Space Station (ISS) and face the ram direction of the ISS to point toward the
Earth rim. Observing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) transmitted through the
atmosphere, we will measure the absorption column density via spectroscopy and
thus obtain the density of the upper atmosphere. The X-ray camera is composed
of a slit collimator and two X-ray SOI-CMOS pixel sensors (SOIPIX), and will
stand on its own and make observations, controlled by a CPU-embedded FPGA
"Zynq". We plan to install the SUIM payload on the ISS in 2025 during the solar
maximum. In this paper, we report the overview and the development status of
this project.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Exo-NINJA will realize nearIR R$\sim$4000 diffraction-limited narrow-field
spectro-imaging for characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disk
structures. It uniquely combines mid-R spectroscopy, high throughput, and
spatial resolution, in contrast to CHARIS, which does spectro-imaging, and
REACH, which is single-point (no spatial resolution). Exo-NINJA's
spectro-imaging at the telescope diffraction limit will characterize exoplanet
atmospheres, detect and map (spatially and spectrally) gas accretion on
protoplanets, and also detect exoplanets at small angular separation
($\lambda$/D) from their host star by spectro-astrometry. Exo-NINJA will link
two instruments at the Subaru Telescope using a high-throughput hexagonal
multi-mode fiber bundle (hexabundle). The fiber coupling resides between the
high contrast imaging system SCExAO, which combines ExAO and coronagraph, and
the medium-resolution spectrograph NINJA (R$=$4000 at JHK bands). Exo-NINJA
will provide an end-to-end throughput of 20% compared to the 1.5% obtained with
REACH. Exo-NINJA is scheduled for implementation on the Subaru Telescope's
NasIR platform in 2025; we will present a concise overview of its future
installation, laboratory tests such as the throughput and focal ratio
degradation (FRD) performance of optical fiber imaging hexabundles, in the NIR
and the trade-offs for fiber choices for the NINJA-SCExAO hexabundle fiber
cable, and the expected on sky performance.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS)
on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse
spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars,
wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral
resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series
spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing
binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the
shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We
find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom
data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge
migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the
point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time
series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al.
suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from
the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that
the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently
stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of
this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra
over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as
observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary
star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to
near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral
resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in
the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for estimating the distance-weighted age distribution of stars in a galaxy, which they call the "distance-weighted age distribution" (DWAD). They explain that traditional methods for estimating the age of stars in galaxies are limited by their reliance on the assumption that the star formation history of the galaxy is known or can be accurately modeled. The authors argue that this assumption is often unrealistic, as the star formation history of galaxies is complex and varied, and that traditional methods are therefore prone to systematic errors.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors note that previous methods for estimating the age distribution of stars in galaxies have been based on indirect techniques such as isochrone fitting or modeling the galaxy's color-magnitude diagram. These methods are limited by their reliance on assumptions about the star formation history of the galaxy, and can result in biased estimates of the age distribution. The authors argue that their proposed method, which uses direct measurements of the stellar distances and radial velocities, is more accurate and less susceptible to systematic errors than previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose a new method for estimating the distance-weighted age distribution of stars in galaxies using direct measurements of the stellar distances and radial velocities. They explain that this method is based on the assumption that the distance to a star is directly related to its age, and that the radial velocity of a star can be used to estimate its distance. The authors then demonstrate the effectiveness of their method using simulations and real data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) mission.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 1 shows the simulation results demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method, while Table 2 provides a summary of the simulations used to test the method's performance. These figures and table are referred to multiple times throughout the paper and are considered the most important for illustrating the method's capabilities.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several previous studies on the topic of galaxy evolution and star formation, including works by VandenBerg (2013), Tomkin & Lambert (1989), and Wakeford & Sing (2015). These references are cited to provide context for the proposed method and to demonstrate its relevance to existing research in the field.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed method has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of galaxy evolution and star formation by providing a more accurate estimate of the age distribution of stars in galaxies. They also note that the method could be used to test models of galaxy evolution and star formation, and to constrain the properties of dark matter and dark energy.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed method relies on assumptions about the accuracy of the distance and radial velocity measurements, which could introduce systematic errors. They also note that the method is limited to galaxies with sufficient data quality and quantity to enable accurate measurements of the stellar distances and radial velocities.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: I cannot provide a Github repository link for this paper as it is not a software development project. However, the authors may have made additional materials or supplementary information available on their personal websites or through a repository host like GitLab or Bitbucket.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>With the launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the
advent of microcalorimeter detectors, X-ray astrophysics is entering in a new
era of spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy. But while this new
generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their
predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial
resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is
currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as
galaxy clusters of supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of
XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and
seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both
generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have
implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM
and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model
adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle
hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of
regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank
approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test
our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova
remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when
the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the
low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less
spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral
variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked
best. After demonstrating a proof of concept in this article, we aim to apply
this method to real X-ray astrophysical data in the near future.</p>

          <p>In astrochemistry, computational methods play a crucial role in addressing
fundamental astronomical questions. Interstellar molecules profoundly influence
the chemistry and physics of the interstellar medium (ISM), playing pivotal
roles in planet formation and the emergence of life. Understanding their
chemistry relies on theoretical approaches such as Density Functional Theory
(DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, which are essential for exploring pathways
to molecular complexity and determining their interstellar abundances. Various
theoretical methods investigate the formation of interstellar molecules in both
gaseous and solid states. Molecules in interstellar space may originate from
bottom-up processes (building up from CO molecules) or top-down processes
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fragmentation). Here, we present a journey of
theoretical investigations aimed at studying the reactivity of interstellar
molecules in space.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>How does molecular complexity emerge and evolve during the process leading to
the formation of a planetary system? Astrochemistry is experiencing a golden
age, marked by significant advancements in the observation and understanding of
the chemical processes occurring in the inner regions of protostellar systems.
However, many questions remain open, such as the origin of the chemical
diversity observed in the early evolutionary stages, which may influence the
chemical composition of the forming planets. Additionally, astrochemistry
provides us with powerful tools to investigate the accretion/ejection processes
occurring in the inner regions of young embedded objects, such as jets, winds,
accretion streamers, and shocks. In this chapter, we review the observational
efforts carried out in recent years to chemically characterize the inner
regions of Solar-System analogs. We summarize our current understanding of
molecular complexity in planet-forming disks and shed light on the existing
limitations and unanswered questions. Finally, we highlight the important role
of future radio facilities, like SKAO and ngVLA, in exploring the chemical
complexity of the regions where planetary systems are emerging.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Binary interactions have been proposed to explain a variety of circumstellar
structures seen around evolved stars, including asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars and planetary nebulae. Studies resolving the circumstellar envelopes of
AGB stars have revealed spirals, discs and bipolar outflows, with shaping
attributed to interactions with a companion. For the first time, we have used a
combined chemical and dynamical analysis to reveal a highly eccentric and
long-period orbit for W Aquilae, a binary system containing an AGB star and a
main sequence companion. Our results are based on anisotropic SiN emission, the
first detections of NS and SiC towards an S-type star, and density structures

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>How does molecular complexity emerge and evolve during the process leading to
the formation of a planetary system? Astrochemistry is experiencing a golden
age, marked by significant advancements in the observation and understanding of
the chemical processes occurring in the inner regions of protostellar systems.
However, many questions remain open, such as the origin of the chemical
diversity observed in the early evolutionary stages, which may influence the
chemical composition of the forming planets. Additionally, astrochemistry
provides us with powerful tools to investigate the accretion/ejection processes
occurring in the inner regions of young embedded objects, such as jets, winds,
accretion streamers, and shocks. In this chapter, we review the observational
efforts carried out in recent years to chemically characterize the inner
regions of Solar-System analogs. We summarize our current understanding of
molecular complexity in planet-forming disks and shed light on the existing
limitations and unanswered questions. Finally, we highlight the important role
of future radio facilities, like SKAO and ngVLA, in exploring the chemical
complexity of the regions where planetary systems are emerging.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advancements in lithium battery technology heavily rely on the design and
engineering of electrolytes. However, current schemes for molecular design and
recipe optimization of electrolytes lack an effective
computational-experimental closed loop and often fall short in accurately
predicting diverse electrolyte formulation properties. In this work, we
introduce Uni-ELF, a novel multi-level representation learning framework to
advance electrolyte design. Our approach involves two-stage pretraining:
reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures at the molecular level
using the Uni-Mol model, and predicting statistical structural properties
(e.g., radial distribution functions) from molecular dynamics simulations at
the mixture level. Through this comprehensive pretraining, Uni-ELF is able to
capture intricate molecular and mixture-level information, which significantly
enhances its predictive capability. As a result, Uni-ELF substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting both molecular properties
(e.g., melting point, boiling point, synthesizability) and formulation
properties (e.g., conductivity, Coulombic efficiency). Moreover, Uni-ELF can be
seamlessly integrated into an automatic experimental design workflow. We
believe this innovative framework will pave the way for automated AI-based
electrolyte design and engineering.</p>

version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these
models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing
emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference.
The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested

grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing
2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne.
Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities,
allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to
another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in
training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of
TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable
features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up
The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Proteins play a vital role in biological processes and are indispensable for
living organisms. Accurate representation of proteins is crucial, especially in
drug development. Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in
utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques for unsupervised
learning of protein representations. However, these approaches often focus
solely on the amino acid sequence of proteins and lack factual knowledge about
proteins and their interactions, thus limiting their performance. In this
study, we present GOProteinGNN, a novel architecture that enhances protein
language models by integrating protein knowledge graph information during the
creation of amino acid level representations. Our approach allows for the
integration of information at both the individual amino acid level and the
entire protein level, enabling a comprehensive and effective learning process
through graph-based learning. By doing so, we can capture complex relationships
and dependencies between proteins and their functional annotations, resulting
in more robust and contextually enriched protein representations. Unlike
previous fusion methods, GOProteinGNN uniquely learns the entire protein
knowledge graph during training, which allows it to capture broader relational
nuances and dependencies beyond mere triplets as done in previous work. We
perform a comprehensive evaluation on several downstream tasks demonstrating
that GOProteinGNN consistently outperforms previous methods, showcasing its
effectiveness and establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for protein
representation learning.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce MOSCITO (MOlecular Dynamics Subspace Clustering with Temporal
Observance), a subspace clustering for molecular dynamics data. MOSCITO groups
those timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in
which the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art
methods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time
series data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure
with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the
data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the
clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In
experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the
performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel
single-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains
better segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Persistent homology is an effective method for extracting topological
information, represented as persistent diagrams, of spatial structure data.
Hence it is well-suited for the study of protein structures. Attempts to
incorporate Persistent homology in machine learning methods of protein function
prediction have resulted in several techniques for vectorizing persistent
diagrams. However, current vectorization methods are excessively artificial and
cannot ensure the effective utilization of information or the rationality of
the methods. To address this problem, we propose a more geometrical
vectorization method of persistent diagrams based on maximal margin
classification for Banach space, and additionaly propose a framework that
utilizes topological data analysis to identify proteins with specific
functions. We evaluated our vectorization method using a binary classification
task on proteins and compared it with the statistical methods that exhibit the
best performance among thirteen commonly used vectorization methods. The
experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the statistical
methods in both robustness and precision.</p>

          <p>Water is a fundamental component of life, playing a critical role in
regulating metabolic processes and facilitating the dissolution and transport
of essential molecules. However, the presence of emerging contaminants, such as
pharmaceuticals, poses significant challenges to water quality and safety.
Nanomaterials-based technologies arise as a promising tool to remove those
contaminants from water. Nevertheless, interfacial water plays a major role in
the adsorption of chemical compounds in the nanomaterials - as it plays in
biological processes such as protein folding, enzyme activity, and drug
delivery. To understand this role, in this study we employ Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations to explore the adsorption dynamics of potassium diclofenac
(K-DCF) on single-walled (SWCNT) and double-walled (DWCNT) carbon nanotubes,
considering both dry and wet conditions. Our findings reveal that the
structuring of water molecules around CNTs creates hydration layers that
significantly influence the accessibility of active sites and the interaction
strength between contaminants and adsorbents. Our analysis indicates higher
energy barriers for adsorption in DWCNTs compared to SWCNTs, which is
attributed to stronger water-surface interactions. This research highlights the
importance of understanding nanoscale water behavior for optimizing the design
and functionality of nanomaterials for water purification. These findings can
guide the development of more efficient and selective nanomaterials, enhancing
contaminant removal and ensuring safer water resources, while also contributing
to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological interactions.</p>

          <p>The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in
condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting
(metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a
material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions
exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal
distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent
studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators,
exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we
investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport
properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction
correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic,
insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties
of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter
adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical
state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal
and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave
functions fulfill "holographic" area laws, and the correlation fractal
dimension is precisely $d_2=2$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Plasmonic surface lattice resonance (SLR) is a phenomenon in which individual
localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) excited in periodically-arranged
plasmonic nanoparticles couple through the interaction with propagating
diffracted incident light. The SLR optical absorption peak is by at least one
order of magnitude more intense than the LSPR one, making SLR superior for
applications in which LSPR is commonly used. Recently, we have developed a
route for the fabrication of spherical virus-like particles (VLPs) with
plasmonic cores and protein coronas, where the LSPR in the cores amplifies
vibrational signals originating from protein-antibody bonding, showing the
potential of VLPs in biodetection. However, the signals were not strong enough
to detect antibodies at very low concentrations. Here, we show that by ordering
the VLPs in periodic nanoarrays exhibiting SLR amplifies the signals by two
orders of magnitude, revealing superior potential of SLR arrays in
ultrasensitive biodetection.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce MOSCITO (MOlecular Dynamics Subspace Clustering with Temporal
Observance), a subspace clustering for molecular dynamics data. MOSCITO groups
those timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in
which the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art
methods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time
series data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure
with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the
data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the
clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In
experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the
performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel
single-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains
better segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers. The
cellular functions of the resulting membraneless organelles are closely linked
to their physical properties over a wide range of length- and timescales: From
the nanosecond dynamics of individual molecules and their interactions, to the
microsecond translational diffusion of molecules in the condensates, to their
viscoelastic properties at the mesoscopic scale. However, it has remained
unclear how to quantitatively link these properties across scales. Here we
address this question by combining single-molecule fluorescence, correlation
spectroscopy, microrheology, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on
different condensates that are formed by complex coacervation and span about
two orders of magnitude in viscosity and their dynamics at the molecular scale.
Remarkably, we find that the absolute timescale of protein chain dynamics in
the dense phases can be quantitatively and accurately related to translational
diffusion and condensate viscosities by Rouse theory of polymer solutions
including entanglement. The simulations indicate that the observed wide range
of dynamics arises from different contact lifetimes between amino acid
residues, which in the mean-field description of the polymer model cause
differences in the friction acting on the chains. These results suggest that
remarkably simple physical principles can relate the mesoscale properties of
biomolecular condensates to their dynamics at the nanoscale.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The transport of particles through channels holds immense significance in
physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. For instance, the motion of
solutes through biological channels is facilitated by specialized proteins that
create water-filled channels and valuable insights can be obtained by studying
the transition paths of particles through a channel and gathering statistics on
their lifetimes within the channel or their exit probabilities. In a similar
vein, we consider a one-dimensional model of channel-facilitated transport
where a diffusive particle is subject to attractive interactions with the walls
within a limited region of the channel. We study the statistics of conditional
and unconditional escape times, in the presence of resetting--an intermittent
dynamics that brings the particle back to its initial coordinate randomly. We
determine analytically the physical conditions under which such resetting
mechanism can become beneficial for faster escape of the particles from the
channel thus enhancing the transport. Our theory has been verified with the aid
of Brownian dynamics simulations for various interaction strengths and extent.
The overall results presented herein highlight the scope of resetting-based
strategies to be universally promising for complex transport processes of
single or long molecules through biological membranes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to
structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the
general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding
and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of
protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the
positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as
well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics
with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands
terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are
of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown
to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective
interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to
proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g.,
patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those
observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking
forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic
nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: The problem statement of the paper is to investigate the relationship between the surface properties of metal complexes of nitrogen-containing ligands (MCNPs) and their reactivity towards proteins. The authors aim to develop a predictive model for the binding affinity of MCNPs to proteins based on their surface properties.</p>
          <p>A: Previous studies have mainly focused on the effect of ligand structure on MCNP binding affinity, while neglecting the impact of surface properties. This paper improves upon the previous state of the art by incorporating surface properties into the binding affinity prediction model.</p>
          <p>Q: The experiments proposed and carried out in the paper involve calculating the distribution of surface properties across 14,963 proteins and MCNPs, as well as analyzing the distribution of hydrophobicity, electric potential, and area fraction of polar residues on protein surfaces. Additionally, the authors conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the orientation of ligands w.r.t. the NP surface and the root mean square angular fluctuation (RMSAF) per ligand.</p>
          <p>A: The most frequently referenced figures in the text are Figures 2-5, which show the distributions of surface properties across proteins and MCNPs, as well as the molecular dynamics simulations results. These figures are important for visualizing the patterns and trends observed in the data.</p>
          <p>Q: The most frequently cited references in the paper are those related to the development of machine learning models for predicting binding affinity, such as Morris et al. (2013) and Gao et al. (2017). These citations were given in the context of comparing the performance of the authors' proposed model with existing methods.</p>
          <p>A: The paper has the potential to be impactful because it introduces a novel approach to predicting MCNP binding affinity based on surface properties, which could lead to improved drug design and development. Additionally, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between protein-ligand interactions and surface properties, which could inform future research in this area.</p>
          <p>Q: Some of the weaknesses of the paper include the reliance on a limited dataset for training the machine learning model, which may limit the generalizability of the predictions. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their approach does not account for all possible surface properties of proteins and MCNPs, which could result in potential bias in the predictions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Measurements of the upper atmosphere at ~100 km are important to investigate
climate change, space weather forecasting, and the interaction between the Sun
and the Earth. Atmospheric occultations of cosmic X-ray sources are an
effective technique to measure the neutral density in the upper atmosphere. We
are developing the instrument SUIM dedicated to continuous observations of
atmospheric occultations. SUIM will be mounted on a platform on the exterior of
the International Space Station for six months and pointed at the Earth's rim
to observe atmospheric absorption of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). In this
paper, we conducted a feasibility study of SUIM by estimating the CXB
statistics and the fraction of the non-X-ray background (NXB) in the observed
data. The estimated CXB statistics are enough to evaluate the atmospheric
absorption of CXB for every 15 km of altitude. On the other hand, the NXB will
be dominant in the X-ray spectra of SUIM. Assuming that the NXB per detection
area of SUIM is comparable to that of the soft X-ray Imager onboard Hitomi, the
NXB level will be much higher than the CXB one and account for ~80% of the
total SUIM spectra.</p>

          <p>Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of
the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy
budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and
yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface
Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed
albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range.
These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and
their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral
bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength
range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve
atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate
hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of
hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils,
vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in
the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with
a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain
hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\deg} in latitude
and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of
1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles
of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces,
and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine
calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve
climate simulations.</p>

          <p>Planetary surface habitability has so far been, in the main, considered in
its entirety. The increasing popularity of 3D modelling studies of
(exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a more nuanced
understanding of surface habitability. Using satellite-derived data of
photosynthetic life to represent the observed surface habitability of modern
Earth, we validate a set of climatologically-defined metrics previously used in
exoplanetary habitability studies. The comparison finds that the metrics
defined by temperature show spatial patterns of habitability distinct to those
defined by aridity, with no metric able to completely replicate the observed.
We build upon these results to introduce a new metric defined by the observed
thermal limits of modern Earth-based life, along with surface water fluxes as
an analogue for water and nutrient availability. Furthermore, we pay attention
to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally
the limits of microbial life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's
own biosignatures, thus expanding considerations of climatic habitability out
of a historically binary definition. Repeating the validation for our metric
finds a significant improvement in the spatial representation of habitability,
laying the groundwork for more accurate assessments of potential
life-supporting environments upon other planets.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In this paper, we assess the scientific promise and technology feasibility of
distributed instruments for planetary science. A distributed instrument is an
instrument designed to collect spatially and temporally correlated data from
multiple networked, geographically distributed point sensors. Distributed
instruments are ubiquitous in Earth science, where they are routinely employed
for weather and climate science, seismic studies and resource prospecting, and
detection of industrial emissions. However, to date, their adoption in
planetary surface science has been minimal. It is natural to ask whether this
lack of adoption is driven by low potential to address high-priority questions
in planetary science; immature technology; or both. To address this question,
we survey high-priority planetary science questions that are uniquely
well-suited to distributed instruments. We identify four areas of research
where distributed instruments hold promise to unlock answers that are largely
inaccessible to monolithic sensors, namely, weather and climate studies of
Mars; localization of seismic events on rocky and icy bodies; localization of
trace gas emissions, primarily on Mars; and magnetometry studies of internal
composition. Next, we survey enabling technologies for distributed sensors and
assess their maturity. We identify sensor placement (including descent and
landing on planetary surfaces), power, and instrument autonomy as three key
areas requiring further investment to enable future distributed instruments.
Overall, this work shows that distributed instruments hold great promise for
planetary science, and paves the way for follow-on studies of future
distributed instruments for Solar System in-situ science.</p>
