          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well
motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by
precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have
distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus,
they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular
scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy
of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics
sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can
be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral
spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for
time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a
complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such
hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This study presents a long-range descriptor for machine learning force fields
(MLFFs) that maintains translational and rotational symmetry, similar to
short-range descriptors while being able to incorporate long-range
electrostatic interactions. The proposed descriptor is based on an atomic
density representation and is structurally similar to classical short-range
atom-centered descriptors, making it straightforward to integrate into machine
learning schemes. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through
comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a
toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors
below 0.1%. The application of our descriptors, in combination with local
descriptors representing the atomic density, to materials where
monopole-monopole interactions are important such as sodium chloride
successfully captures long-range interactions, improving predictive accuracy.
The study highlights the limitations of the combined LODE method in materials
where intermediate-range effects play a significant role. Our work presents a
promising approach to addressing the challenge of incorporating long-range
interactions into MLFFs, which enhances predictive accuracy for charged
materials to the level of state-of-the-art Message Passing Neural Networks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The combination of deep learning and ab initio materials calculations is
emerging as a trending frontier of materials science research, with
deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure being
particularly promising. In this work, we introduce a neural-network method for
modeling the DFT density matrix, a fundamental yet previously unexplored
quantity in deep-learning electronic structure. Utilizing an advanced neural
network framework that leverages the nearsightedness and equivariance
properties of the density matrix, the method demonstrates high accuracy and
excellent generalizability in multiple example studies, as well as capability
to precisely predict charge density and reproduce other electronic structure
properties. Given the pivotal role of the density matrix in DFT as well as
other computational methods, the current research introduces a novel approach
to the deep-learning study of electronic structure properties, opening up new
opportunities for deep-learning enhanced computational materials study.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no
surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for
machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially
true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both
established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are
built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of
the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains
the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are
often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric
models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be
beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational
invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving
simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on
physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly
-- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used
in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase
predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are
noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically
reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their
impact on the convergence of observables.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water at 300 K using a Physically Informed Random Walk (PIRW) model with on-the-fly random augmentation and a fixed 2i grid rotational averaging. Specifically, they aim to compute the orientational free energy for the water molecule, O-O pair correlation function, and molecular orientation correlation function, as well as to study the dynamical properties of liquid water using the PET model.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous works that used classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water. However, MD simulations are computationally expensive and can only provide a coarse-grained representation of the system. In contrast, the PIRW model allows for a more efficient and detailed investigation of the system. The paper demonstrates that the PIRW model can capture the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water with higher accuracy than MD simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper performed simulations using the PIRW model to compute the orientational free energy for the water molecule, O-O pair correlation function, and molecular orientation correlation function. They also studied the dynamical properties of liquid water using the PET model with random and 2i-grid rotational averaging.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the problem statement and research questions of the paper, while Figure 2 presents the previous state of the art. Figure 3 displays the orientational free energy for the water molecule and O-O pair correlation function, and Figure 4 exhibits the dynamical properties of liquid water.

A: The reference [6] by Bussi and Parrinello is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a framework for understanding the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water using a physically informed model. The references [1], [2], [3], and [5] are also cited to provide additional context and support for the results obtained using the PIRW model.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel approach to studying the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water using a physically informed random walk model, which can be more efficient and accurate than previous methods. The results obtained using the PIRW model have important implications for understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of liquid water, which is essential for various fields such as chemistry, physics, biology, and environmental science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the PIRW model is a simplification of the true molecular dynamics of liquid water, which may not capture all of the complex interactions between water molecules. Additionally, the fixed 2i grid rotational averaging used in the simulations may not fully capture the rotational dynamics of the water molecules.</p>

          <p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$)
provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing
transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating
self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are
particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled $d$ and $f$ electronic
states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate
determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In
practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior
knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive
first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based
on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as
descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical
environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the
prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative
linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation
theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data
from 11 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our
model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and
$V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or
DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the
prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while
approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust
transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and
design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various
technological applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent SO(3)-equivariant models embedded a molecule as a set of single atoms
fixed in the three-dimensional space, which is analogous to a ball-and-stick
view. This perspective provides a concise view of atom arrangements, however,
the surrounding electron density cannot be represented and its polarization
effects may be underestimated. To overcome this limitation, we propose
\textit{Neural Polarization}, a novel method extending equivariant network by
embedding each atom as a pair of fixed and moving points. Motivated by density
functional theory, Neural Polarization represents molecules as a space-filling
view which includes an electron density, in contrast with a ball-and-stick
view. Neural Polarization can flexibly be applied to most type of existing
equivariant models. We showed that Neural Polarization can improve prediction
performances of existing models over a wide range of targets. Finally, we
verified that our method can improve the expressiveness and equivariance in
terms of mathematical aspects.</p>

          <p>With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning
approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are
increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning
models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to
translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning
approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane,
such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by
using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of
2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved
model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we
consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the
classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of
Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier
descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform
equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the
classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational
runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least
informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only
incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Depression recognition based on physiological signals such as functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) has made
considerable progress. However, most existing studies ignore the
complementarity and semantic consistency of multimodal physiological signals
under the same stimulation task in complex spatio-temporal patterns. In this
paper, we introduce a multimodal physiological signals representation learning
framework using Siamese architecture via multiscale contrasting for depression
recognition (MRLMC). First, fNIRS and EEG are transformed into different but
correlated data based on a time-domain data augmentation strategy. Then, we
design a spatio-temporal contrasting module to learn the representation of
fNIRS and EEG through weight-sharing multiscale spatio-temporal convolution.
Furthermore, to enhance the learning of semantic representation associated with
stimulation tasks, a semantic consistency contrast module is proposed, aiming
to maximize the semantic similarity of fNIRS and EEG. Extensive experiments on
publicly available and self-collected multimodal physiological signals datasets
indicate that MRLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our
proposed framework is capable of transferring to multimodal time series
downstream tasks.</p>

          <p>Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and
chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food
quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic
data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission
matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and
sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due
to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study
proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision
models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these
challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks
described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the
physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is
demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin
olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality
indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved
in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the
use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a
tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct
research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both
astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually
support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their
respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol
(CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex
organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are
higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive
energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the
BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the
TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due
to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT
calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The
behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing
adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their
computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions
compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol,
ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species
in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the
central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already
frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in
water-rich planetesimals.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct
research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both
astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually
support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their
respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol
(CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex
organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are
higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive
energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the
BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the
TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due
to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT
calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The
behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing
adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their
computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions
compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol,
ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species
in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the
central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already
frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in
water-rich planetesimals.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The scarcity of property labels remains a key challenge in materials
informatics, whereas materials data without property labels are abundant in
comparison. By pretraining supervised property prediction models on
self-supervised tasks that depend only on the "intrinsic information" available
in any Crystallographic Information File (CIF), there is potential to leverage
the large amount of crystal data without property labels to improve property
prediction results on small datasets. We apply Deep InfoMax as a
self-supervised machine learning framework for materials informatics that
explicitly maximises the mutual information between a point set (or graph)
representation of a crystal and a vector representation suitable for downstream
learning. This allows the pretraining of supervised models on large materials
datasets without the need for property labels and without requiring the model
to reconstruct the crystal from a representation vector. We investigate the
benefits of Deep InfoMax pretraining implemented on the Site-Net architecture
to improve the performance of downstream property prediction models with small
amounts (<10^3) of data, a situation relevant to experimentally measured
materials property databases. Using a property label masking methodology, where
we perform self-supervised learning on larger supervised datasets and then
train supervised models on a small subset of the labels, we isolate Deep
InfoMax pretraining from the effects of distributional shift. We demonstrate
performance improvements in the contexts of representation learning and
transfer learning on the tasks of band gap and formation energy prediction.
Having established the effectiveness of Deep InfoMax pretraining in a
controlled environment, our findings provide a foundation for extending the
approach to address practical challenges in materials informatics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and
engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function
that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations.
Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities
via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for
surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to
produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the
scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges
of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we
introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for
black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain.
To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer
and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on
a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can
generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular
optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</p>

          <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen growing adoption across
various scientific disciplines. These advancements encourage the investigation
of molecule-text modeling within synthetic chemistry, a field dedicated to
designing and conducting chemical reactions to synthesize new compounds with
desired properties and applications. Current approaches, however, often neglect
the critical role of multiple molecule graph interaction in understanding
chemical reactions, leading to suboptimal performance in synthetic chemistry
tasks. This study introduces PRESTO(Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic

gap by integrating a comprehensive benchmark of pretraining strategies and
dataset configurations. It progressively improves multimodal LLMs through
cross-modal alignment and multi-graph understanding. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that PRESTO offers competitive results in downstream synthetic

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery,
significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in
silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for
small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate
compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose
Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates
directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box
synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates.
We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it
is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger
than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also
show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further
increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained
proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of geomagnetic storms, which
may cause severe space weather effects. Automating the detection, tracking, and
three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CMEs is important for operational
predictions of CME arrivals. The COR1 coronagraphs on board the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft have facilitated extensive
polarization observations, which are very suitable for the establishment of a
3D CME system. We have developed such a 3D system comprising four modules:
classification, segmentation, tracking, and 3D reconstructions. We generalize
our previously pretrained classification model to classify COR1 coronagraph
images. Subsequently, as there are no publicly available CME segmentation data
sets, we manually annotate the structural regions of CMEs using Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 observations. Leveraging transformer-based models,
we achieve state-of-the-art results in CME segmentation. Furthermore, we
improve the tracking algorithm to solve the difficult separation task of
multiple CMEs. In the final module, tracking results, combined with the
polarization ratio technique are used to develop the first single-view 3D CME
catalog without requiring manual mask annotation. Our method provides higher
precision in automatic 2D CME catalog and more reliable physical parameters of
CMEs, including 3D propagation direction and speed. The aforementioned 3D CME
system can be applied to any coronagraph data with the capability of
polarization measurements.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, notably CH4 and CO2, has
fueled global temperature increases, intensifying concerns regarding the
prevailing climate crisis. Effectively monitoring these gases demands a
detector spanning the extended short-wavelength infrared (~2.4 {\mu}m) range,
covering wavelengths of CH4 (1.65 {\mu}m) and CO2 (2.05 {\mu}m). The
state-of-the-art HgCdTe avalanche photodetectors (APDs) offer exceptional
performance metrics, including high gain (M) and low excess noise (F). However,
their widespread adoption is hindered by inherent challenges such as
manufacturability, reproducibility, and cost factors. Moreover, their reliance
on cryogenic cooling adds to the cost, size, weight, and power of the system.
We have demonstrated a linear mode APD combining an InGaAs/GaAsSb type-II
superlattice absorber and an AlGaAsSb multiplier lattice matched to InP
substrates. This APD has demonstrated a room temperature M of 178, a maximum
measurable external quantum efficiency of 3560 % at 2 {\mu}m, an extremely low
excess noise (F < 2 at M < 20), and a small temperature coefficient of
breakdown (7.58 mV/K {\mu}m). Such a high performance APD with manufacturable
semiconductor materials could lead to a rapid transition to a commercial III-V
foundry, holding the promise of revolutionizing high-sensitivity receivers for
greenhouse gas monitoring.</p>

          <p>Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth's
surface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of
regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface
temperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),
ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent
(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by
a conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)
and 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and
Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since
2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide
fingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar
(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both
surface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016
once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,
which caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by
the positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to
improved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated
results by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose
destruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven
reaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of
rapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic
amplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that
started at the end of 2023.</p>

          <p>There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at
extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the
irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01
AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such
systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by
various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct
consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees
beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher
than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes
crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The
error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one
percent making our estimate very reliable.</p>

          <p>White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for
signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly
understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any
planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around
M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf
planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to
several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate
the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations
show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter
a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation
regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a
displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the
midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow
water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and
decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by
$\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around
nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work
underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique
atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf
systems.</p>

to the carbon footprint of astrophysical research. Being part of the
collaboration that currently develops the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array, a ground-based observatory for very-high-energy
gamma rays that will comprise 64 telescopes deployed on two sites, we assessed
the environmental impacts of one MST on the Northern site by means of a Life
Cycle Assessment. We identified resource use and climate change as the most
significant impacts, being driven by telescope manufacturing and energy
consumption during operations. We estimate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
of 2,660 +/- 274 tCO2 equivalent for the telescope, 44% of which arise from
construction, 1% from on-site assembly and commissioning, and 55% from
operations over 30 years. Environmental impacts can be reduced by using
renewable energies during construction and operations, use of less electronic
components and metal casting, and use of recycled materials. We propose
complementing project requirements with environmental budgets as an effective

          <p>A new observatory site should be investigated for its local climate
conditions to see its potential and limitations. In this respect, we examine
several meteorological parameters at the site of Timau National Observatory,
Indonesia using the ERA5 dataset from 2002 to 2021. Based on this dataset, we
conclude that the surface temperature at Timau is around 18.9 C with a
relatively small temperature variation (1.5 C) over the day. This temperature
stability is expected to give advantages to the observatory. In terms of
humidity and water vapour, Timau is poor for infrared observations as the
median precipitable water vapour exceeds 18 mm, even during the dry season.
However, near-infrared observations are feasible. Even though our cloud cover
analysis confirms the span of the observing season in the region, we find a
significant discrepancy between the clear sky fraction derived from the ERA5
dataset and the one estimated using satellite imagery. Aside from the indicated
bias, our results provide insights and directions for the operation and future
development of the observatory.</p>

          <p>The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to
identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its
membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our
world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our
profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it
possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful
without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for
future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS,
finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences.
We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about
climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should
reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen
recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule
additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the
AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online
interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully
decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as
AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to
do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits --
particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally
have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of
implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint.
They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better
serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more
inclusive, and more productive.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that
exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the
observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of
planetary environments from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial
role in this context, especially now when few data are available to validate
model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet
System Science (NExSS) supports a systematic approach to evaluating the
performance of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for conducting
community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects (exoMIPs). The
CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for
the needs of exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types,
planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help
researchers to work collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals.
The CUISINES framework rests on five principles: 1) Define in advance what
research question(s) the exoMIP is intended to address. 2) Create an
experimental design that maximizes community participation, and advertise it
widely. 3) Plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP members to
participate fully. 4) Generate data products from model output for direct
comparison to observations. 5) Create a data management plan that is workable
in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its
existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10 exoMIPs, and
will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback and
presentation of new exoMIP ideas.</p>
