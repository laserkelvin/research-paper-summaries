          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well
motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by
precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have
distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus,
they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular
scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy
of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics
sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can
be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral
spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for
time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a
complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such
hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for calculating electron spin-rotation tensors using first-principles calculations, which can improve upon previous methods that rely on empirical formulas or numerical simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in calculating electron spin-rotation tensors was based on empirical formulas or numerical simulations, which were limited in accuracy and applicability to specific classes of molecules. This paper introduces a new method that is based on first-principles calculations, allowing for more accurate and flexible predictions of electron spin-rotation tensors.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors propose and carry out first-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate electron spin-rotation tensors for a set of molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 2, and 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide examples of the accuracy and applicability of the new method for calculating electron spin-rotation tensors. Table 1 is also referenced frequently, as it provides a summary of the computational results obtained using the new method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [78] by G. Tarczay, P. G. Szalay, and J. Gauss is cited the most frequently, as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the electron spin-rotation tensors of molecules. The reference [91] by M. N. Glukhovtsev, A. Pross, M. P. McGrath, and L. Radom is also cited frequently, as it provides a method for extending Gaussian-2 theory to molecules containing third-row atoms.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper could have a significant impact on the field of quantum chemistry and molecular physics, as it introduces a new method for calculating electron spin-rotation tensors that is more accurate and flexible than previous methods. This could lead to a better understanding of the electronic structure and properties of molecules, which could have implications for fields such as drug discovery and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors mention that their method is limited to simple molecules and may not be applicable to more complex systems, such as those with multiple bonds or rings. Additionally, the accuracy of the method relies on the quality of the DFT calculations, which can be affected by the choice of exchange-correlation functional and other parameters.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Provide up to ten hashtags that describe this paper.
