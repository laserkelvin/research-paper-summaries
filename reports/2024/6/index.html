          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well
motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by
precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have
distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus,
they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular
scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy
of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics
sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can
be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral
spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for
time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a
complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such
hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This study presents a long-range descriptor for machine learning force fields
(MLFFs) that maintains translational and rotational symmetry, similar to
short-range descriptors while being able to incorporate long-range
electrostatic interactions. The proposed descriptor is based on an atomic
density representation and is structurally similar to classical short-range
atom-centered descriptors, making it straightforward to integrate into machine
learning schemes. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through
comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a
toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors
below 0.1%. The application of our descriptors, in combination with local
descriptors representing the atomic density, to materials where
monopole-monopole interactions are important such as sodium chloride
successfully captures long-range interactions, improving predictive accuracy.
The study highlights the limitations of the combined LODE method in materials
where intermediate-range effects play a significant role. Our work presents a
promising approach to addressing the challenge of incorporating long-range
interactions into MLFFs, which enhances predictive accuracy for charged
materials to the level of state-of-the-art Message Passing Neural Networks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The combination of deep learning and ab initio materials calculations is
emerging as a trending frontier of materials science research, with
deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure being
particularly promising. In this work, we introduce a neural-network method for
modeling the DFT density matrix, a fundamental yet previously unexplored
quantity in deep-learning electronic structure. Utilizing an advanced neural
network framework that leverages the nearsightedness and equivariance
properties of the density matrix, the method demonstrates high accuracy and
excellent generalizability in multiple example studies, as well as capability
to precisely predict charge density and reproduce other electronic structure
properties. Given the pivotal role of the density matrix in DFT as well as
other computational methods, the current research introduces a novel approach
to the deep-learning study of electronic structure properties, opening up new
opportunities for deep-learning enhanced computational materials study.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no
surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for
machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially
true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both
established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are
built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of
the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains
the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are
often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric
models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be
beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational
invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving
simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on
physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly
-- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used
in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase
predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are
noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically
reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their
impact on the convergence of observables.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water at 300 K using a Physically Informed Random Walk (PIRW) model with on-the-fly random augmentation and a fixed 2i grid rotational averaging. Specifically, they aim to compute the orientational free energy for the water molecule, O-O pair correlation function, and molecular orientation correlation function, as well as to study the dynamical properties of liquid water using the PET model.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon previous works that used classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water. However, MD simulations are computationally expensive and can only provide a coarse-grained representation of the system. In contrast, the PIRW model allows for a more efficient and detailed investigation of the system. The paper demonstrates that the PIRW model can capture the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water with higher accuracy than MD simulations.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper performed simulations using the PIRW model to compute the orientational free energy for the water molecule, O-O pair correlation function, and molecular orientation correlation function. They also studied the dynamical properties of liquid water using the PET model with random and 2i-grid rotational averaging.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1-4 and Tables 1-3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 1 shows the problem statement and research questions of the paper, while Figure 2 presents the previous state of the art. Figure 3 displays the orientational free energy for the water molecule and O-O pair correlation function, and Figure 4 exhibits the dynamical properties of liquid water.

A: The reference [6] by Bussi and Parrinello is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a framework for understanding the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water using a physically informed model. The references [1], [2], [3], and [5] are also cited to provide additional context and support for the results obtained using the PIRW model.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel approach to studying the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water using a physically informed random walk model, which can be more efficient and accurate than previous methods. The results obtained using the PIRW model have important implications for understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of liquid water, which is essential for various fields such as chemistry, physics, biology, and environmental science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that the PIRW model is a simplification of the true molecular dynamics of liquid water, which may not capture all of the complex interactions between water molecules. Additionally, the fixed 2i grid rotational averaging used in the simulations may not fully capture the rotational dynamics of the water molecules.</p>

          <p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$)
provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing
transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating
self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are
particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled $d$ and $f$ electronic
states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate
determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In
practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior
knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive
first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based
on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as
descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical
environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the
prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative
linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation
theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data
from 11 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our
model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and
$V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or
DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the
prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while
approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust
transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and
design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various
technological applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recent SO(3)-equivariant models embedded a molecule as a set of single atoms
fixed in the three-dimensional space, which is analogous to a ball-and-stick
view. This perspective provides a concise view of atom arrangements, however,
the surrounding electron density cannot be represented and its polarization
effects may be underestimated. To overcome this limitation, we propose
\textit{Neural Polarization}, a novel method extending equivariant network by
embedding each atom as a pair of fixed and moving points. Motivated by density
functional theory, Neural Polarization represents molecules as a space-filling
view which includes an electron density, in contrast with a ball-and-stick
view. Neural Polarization can flexibly be applied to most type of existing
equivariant models. We showed that Neural Polarization can improve prediction
performances of existing models over a wide range of targets. Finally, we
verified that our method can improve the expressiveness and equivariance in
terms of mathematical aspects.</p>

          <p>With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning
approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are
increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning
models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to
translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning
approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane,
such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by
using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of
2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved
model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we
consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the
classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of
Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier
descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform
equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the
classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational
runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least
informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only
incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Depression recognition based on physiological signals such as functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) has made
considerable progress. However, most existing studies ignore the
complementarity and semantic consistency of multimodal physiological signals
under the same stimulation task in complex spatio-temporal patterns. In this
paper, we introduce a multimodal physiological signals representation learning
framework using Siamese architecture via multiscale contrasting for depression
recognition (MRLMC). First, fNIRS and EEG are transformed into different but
correlated data based on a time-domain data augmentation strategy. Then, we
design a spatio-temporal contrasting module to learn the representation of
fNIRS and EEG through weight-sharing multiscale spatio-temporal convolution.
Furthermore, to enhance the learning of semantic representation associated with
stimulation tasks, a semantic consistency contrast module is proposed, aiming
to maximize the semantic similarity of fNIRS and EEG. Extensive experiments on
publicly available and self-collected multimodal physiological signals datasets
indicate that MRLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our
proposed framework is capable of transferring to multimodal time series
downstream tasks.</p>

          <p>Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and
chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food
quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic
data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission
matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and
sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due
to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study
proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision
models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these
challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks
described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the
physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is
demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin
olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality
indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved
in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the
use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a
tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct
research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both
astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually
support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their
respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol
(CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex
organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are
higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive
energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the
BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the
TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due
to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT
calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The
behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing
adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their
computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions
compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol,
ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species
in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the
central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already
frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in
water-rich planetesimals.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct
research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both
astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually
support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their
respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol
(CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex
organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are
higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive
energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the
BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the
TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and
CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due
to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT
calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The
behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing
adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their
computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions
compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol,
ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species
in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the
central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already
frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in
water-rich planetesimals.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The scarcity of property labels remains a key challenge in materials
informatics, whereas materials data without property labels are abundant in
comparison. By pretraining supervised property prediction models on
self-supervised tasks that depend only on the "intrinsic information" available
in any Crystallographic Information File (CIF), there is potential to leverage
the large amount of crystal data without property labels to improve property
prediction results on small datasets. We apply Deep InfoMax as a
self-supervised machine learning framework for materials informatics that
explicitly maximises the mutual information between a point set (or graph)
representation of a crystal and a vector representation suitable for downstream
learning. This allows the pretraining of supervised models on large materials
datasets without the need for property labels and without requiring the model
to reconstruct the crystal from a representation vector. We investigate the
benefits of Deep InfoMax pretraining implemented on the Site-Net architecture
to improve the performance of downstream property prediction models with small
amounts (<10^3) of data, a situation relevant to experimentally measured
materials property databases. Using a property label masking methodology, where
we perform self-supervised learning on larger supervised datasets and then
train supervised models on a small subset of the labels, we isolate Deep
InfoMax pretraining from the effects of distributional shift. We demonstrate
performance improvements in the contexts of representation learning and
transfer learning on the tasks of band gap and formation energy prediction.
Having established the effectiveness of Deep InfoMax pretraining in a
controlled environment, our findings provide a foundation for extending the
approach to address practical challenges in materials informatics.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and
engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function
that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations.
Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities
via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for
surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to
produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the
scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges
of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we
introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for
black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain.
To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer
and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on
a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can
generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular
optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</p>

          <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen growing adoption across
various scientific disciplines. These advancements encourage the investigation
of molecule-text modeling within synthetic chemistry, a field dedicated to
designing and conducting chemical reactions to synthesize new compounds with
desired properties and applications. Current approaches, however, often neglect
the critical role of multiple molecule graph interaction in understanding
chemical reactions, leading to suboptimal performance in synthetic chemistry
tasks. This study introduces PRESTO(Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic

gap by integrating a comprehensive benchmark of pretraining strategies and
dataset configurations. It progressively improves multimodal LLMs through
cross-modal alignment and multi-graph understanding. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that PRESTO offers competitive results in downstream synthetic

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery,
significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in
silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for
small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate
compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose
Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates
directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box
synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates.
We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it
is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger
than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also
show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further
increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained
proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of geomagnetic storms, which
may cause severe space weather effects. Automating the detection, tracking, and
three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CMEs is important for operational
predictions of CME arrivals. The COR1 coronagraphs on board the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft have facilitated extensive
polarization observations, which are very suitable for the establishment of a
3D CME system. We have developed such a 3D system comprising four modules:
classification, segmentation, tracking, and 3D reconstructions. We generalize
our previously pretrained classification model to classify COR1 coronagraph
images. Subsequently, as there are no publicly available CME segmentation data
sets, we manually annotate the structural regions of CMEs using Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 observations. Leveraging transformer-based models,
we achieve state-of-the-art results in CME segmentation. Furthermore, we
improve the tracking algorithm to solve the difficult separation task of
multiple CMEs. In the final module, tracking results, combined with the
polarization ratio technique are used to develop the first single-view 3D CME
catalog without requiring manual mask annotation. Our method provides higher
precision in automatic 2D CME catalog and more reliable physical parameters of
CMEs, including 3D propagation direction and speed. The aforementioned 3D CME
system can be applied to any coronagraph data with the capability of
polarization measurements.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, notably CH4 and CO2, has
fueled global temperature increases, intensifying concerns regarding the
prevailing climate crisis. Effectively monitoring these gases demands a
detector spanning the extended short-wavelength infrared (~2.4 {\mu}m) range,
covering wavelengths of CH4 (1.65 {\mu}m) and CO2 (2.05 {\mu}m). The
state-of-the-art HgCdTe avalanche photodetectors (APDs) offer exceptional
performance metrics, including high gain (M) and low excess noise (F). However,
their widespread adoption is hindered by inherent challenges such as
manufacturability, reproducibility, and cost factors. Moreover, their reliance
on cryogenic cooling adds to the cost, size, weight, and power of the system.
We have demonstrated a linear mode APD combining an InGaAs/GaAsSb type-II
superlattice absorber and an AlGaAsSb multiplier lattice matched to InP
substrates. This APD has demonstrated a room temperature M of 178, a maximum
measurable external quantum efficiency of 3560 % at 2 {\mu}m, an extremely low
excess noise (F < 2 at M < 20), and a small temperature coefficient of
breakdown (7.58 mV/K {\mu}m). Such a high performance APD with manufacturable
semiconductor materials could lead to a rapid transition to a commercial III-V
foundry, holding the promise of revolutionizing high-sensitivity receivers for
greenhouse gas monitoring.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Biphasic interfaces are complex but fascinating regimes that display a number
of properties distinct from those of the bulk. The CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, in
particular, has been the subject of a number of studies on account of its
importance for the carbon life cycle as well as carbon capture and
sequestration schemes. Despite this attention, there remain a number of open
questions on the nature of the CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, particularly concerning
the interfacial tension and phase behavior of CO$_2$ at the interface. In this
paper, we seek to address these ambiguities using ab initio-quality
simulations. Harnessing the benefits of machine-learned potentials and enhanced
statistical sampling methods, we present an ab initio-level description of the
CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface. Interfacial tensions are predicted from 1-500 bar and
found to be in close agreement with experiment at the pressures for which
experimental data is available. Structural analyses indicate the build-up of an
adsorbed, saturated CO$_2$ film forming at low pressure (20 bar) with
properties similar to those of the bulk liquid, but preferential perpendicular
alignment with respect to the interface. CO$_2$ monolayer build-up coincides
with a reduced structuring of water molecules close to the interface. This
study highlights the predictive nature of machine-learned potentials for
complex macroscopic properties of biphasic interfaces, and the mechanistic
insight obtained into carbon dioxide aggregation at the water interface is of
high relevance for geoscience, climate research, and materials science.</p>

          <p>Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth's
surface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of
regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface
temperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),
ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent
(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by
a conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)
and 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and
Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since
2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide
fingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar
(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both
surface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016
once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,
which caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by
the positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to
improved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated
results by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose
destruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven
reaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of
rapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic
amplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that
started at the end of 2023.</p>

          <p>There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at
extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the
irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01
AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such
systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by
various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct
consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees
beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher
than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes
crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The
error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one
percent making our estimate very reliable.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for
signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly
understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any
planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around
M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf
planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to
several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate
the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations
show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter
a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation
regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a
displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the
midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow
water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and
decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by
$\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around
nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work
underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique
atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf
systems.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Astronomical observatories have been identified as substantial contributors
to the carbon footprint of astrophysical research. Being part of the
collaboration that currently develops the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array, a ground-based observatory for very-high-energy
gamma rays that will comprise 64 telescopes deployed on two sites, we assessed
the environmental impacts of one MST on the Northern site by means of a Life
Cycle Assessment. We identified resource use and climate change as the most
significant impacts, being driven by telescope manufacturing and energy
consumption during operations. We estimate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
of 2,660 +/- 274 tCO2 equivalent for the telescope, 44% of which arise from
construction, 1% from on-site assembly and commissioning, and 55% from
operations over 30 years. Environmental impacts can be reduced by using
renewable energies during construction and operations, use of less electronic
components and metal casting, and use of recycled materials. We propose
complementing project requirements with environmental budgets as an effective
measure for impact management and reductions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A new observatory site should be investigated for its local climate
conditions to see its potential and limitations. In this respect, we examine
several meteorological parameters at the site of Timau National Observatory,
Indonesia using the ERA5 dataset from 2002 to 2021. Based on this dataset, we
conclude that the surface temperature at Timau is around 18.9 C with a
relatively small temperature variation (1.5 C) over the day. This temperature
stability is expected to give advantages to the observatory. In terms of
humidity and water vapour, Timau is poor for infrared observations as the
median precipitable water vapour exceeds 18 mm, even during the dry season.
However, near-infrared observations are feasible. Even though our cloud cover
analysis confirms the span of the observing season in the region, we find a
significant discrepancy between the clear sky fraction derived from the ERA5
dataset and the one estimated using satellite imagery. Aside from the indicated
bias, our results provide insights and directions for the operation and future
development of the observatory.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to
identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its
membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our
world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our
profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it
possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful
without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for
future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS,
finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences.
We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about
climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should
reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen
recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule
additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the
AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online
interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully
decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as
AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to
do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits --
particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally
have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of
implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint.
They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better
serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more
inclusive, and more productive.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that
exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the
observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of
planetary environments from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial
role in this context, especially now when few data are available to validate
model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet
System Science (NExSS) supports a systematic approach to evaluating the
performance of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for conducting
community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects (exoMIPs). The
CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for
the needs of exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types,
planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help
researchers to work collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals.
The CUISINES framework rests on five principles: 1) Define in advance what
research question(s) the exoMIP is intended to address. 2) Create an
experimental design that maximizes community participation, and advertise it
widely. 3) Plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP members to
participate fully. 4) Generate data products from model output for direct
comparison to observations. 5) Create a data management plan that is workable
in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its
existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10 exoMIPs, and
will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback and
presentation of new exoMIP ideas.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop a new algorithm for estimating the surface temperature of other planets in the solar system based on their spectra, which can be used to improve our understanding of planetary environments and potential biosignatures.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in estimating surface temperature using spectral analysis was limited by the use of simplified atmospheric models and a lack of consideration for the effects of clouds and hazes on the observed spectra. This paper improved upon these limitations by incorporating more complex atmospheric models and accounting for the effects of clouds and hazes on the estimated temperatures.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Bounding and predicting the generalization gap of overparameterized neural
networks remains a central open problem in theoretical machine learning. Neural
network optimization trajectories have been proposed to possess fractal
structure, leading to bounds and generalization measures based on notions of
fractal dimension on these trajectories. Prominently, both the Hausdorff
dimension and the persistent homology dimension have been proposed to correlate
with generalization gap, thus serving as a measure of generalization. This work
performs an extended evaluation of these topological generalization measures.
We demonstrate that fractal dimension fails to predict generalization of models
trained from poor initializations. We further identify that the $\ell^2$ norm
of the final parameter iterate, one of the simplest complexity measures in
learning theory, correlates more strongly with the generalization gap than
these notions of fractal dimension. Finally, our study reveals the intriguing
manifestation of model-wise double descent in persistent homology-based
generalization measures. This work lays the ground for a deeper investigation
of the causal relationships between fractal geometry, topological data
analysis, and neural network optimization.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>A ubiquitous approach to obtain transferable machine learning-based models of
potential energy surfaces for atomistic systems is to decompose the total
energy into a sum of local atom-centred contributions. However, in many systems
non-negligible long-range electrostatic effects must be taken into account as
well. We introduce a general mathematical framework to study how such
long-range effects can be included in a way that (i) allows charge
equilibration and (ii) retains the locality of the learnable atom-centred
contributions to ensure transferability. Our results give partial explanations
for the success of existing machine learned potentials that include
equilibriation and provide perspectives how to design such schemes in a
systematic way. To complement the rigorous theoretical results, we describe a
practical scheme for fitting the energy and electron density of water clusters.</p>

          <p>The TEMPO (Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets in Orion) Survey is a
proposed 30-day observational campaign using the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope. By providing deep, high-resolution, short-cadence infrared
photometry of a dynamic star-forming region, TEMPO will investigate the
demographics of exosatellites orbiting free-floating planets and brown dwarfs
-- a largely unexplored discovery space. Here, we present the simulated
detection yields of three populations: extrasolar moon analogs orbiting
free-floating planets, exosatellites orbiting brown dwarfs, and exoplanets
orbiting young stars. Additionally, we outline a comprehensive range of
anticipated scientific outcomes accompanying such a survey. These science
drivers include: obtaining observational constraints to test prevailing
theories of moon, planet, and star formation; directly detecting widely
separated exoplanets orbiting young stars; investigating the variability of
young stars and brown dwarfs; constraining the low-mass end of the stellar
initial mass function; constructing the distribution of dust in the Orion
Nebula and mapping evolution in the near-infrared extinction law; mapping
emission features that trace the shocked gas in the region; constructing a
dynamical map of Orion members using proper motions; and searching for
extragalactic sources and transients via deep extragalactic observations

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the world. While
deep learning has potential to further improve computer-aided prostate cancer
detection on MRI, its efficacy hinges on the exhaustive curation of manually
annotated images. We propose a novel methodology of semisupervised learning
(SSL) guided by automatically extracted clinical information, specifically the
lesion locations in radiology reports, allowing for use of unannotated images
to reduce the annotation burden. By leveraging lesion locations, we refined
pseudo labels, which were then used to train our location-based SSL model. We
show that our SSL method can improve prostate lesion detection by utilizing
unannotated images, with more substantial impacts being observed when larger
proportions of unannotated images are used.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to develop an end-to-end lung cancer screening system using three-dimensional deep learning on low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) images. The authors note that current lung cancer screening methods rely on CT imaging, but the accuracy of these methods is limited by the quality of the images and the expertise of the interpreting radiologists. The paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the authors, current state-of-the-art methods for lung cancer detection using CT images rely on supervised learning approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These approaches are time-consuming and expensive to develop and maintain, and they may not perform well in real-world scenarios due to variability in image quality and the presence of artifacts. The proposed paper improves upon these methods by using unsupervised learning techniques and a large dataset of low-dose CT images to train a deep neural network for lung cancer detection.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed system. They used a dataset of over 1,000 low-dose CT scans to train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) for lung cancer detection. They evaluated the performance of their CNN using a set of test images and compared it to the performance of a supervised learning approach. They also tested the robustness of their system by evaluating its performance on images with different levels of noise and artifacts.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors referenced Figures 1, 2, and 3 and Tables 1 and 2 most frequently in the text. Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed system, while Figure 2 shows the architecture of the deep neural network used for lung cancer detection. Table 1 lists the characteristics of the dataset used for training and testing, and Table 2 compares the performance of their proposed method with a supervised learning approach.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cited reference [6] the most frequently, as it provides a comprehensive overview of semi-supervised learning techniques that can be applied to medical image analysis tasks such as lung cancer detection. They also cited reference [8] to demonstrate the feasibility of using self-configuring methods for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed system has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening, which could lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. They also note that their approach could be applied to other medical image analysis tasks, such as detecting breast cancer or identifying cardiovascular disease.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed system relies on unsupervised learning techniques, which may not perform as well as supervised learning approaches in certain cases. They also note that their dataset is limited to low-dose CT images and may not generalize well to other imaging modalities or patient populations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation
technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational
challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a
vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key

state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more
flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit
the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and
periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the
flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning
crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard
benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry
calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem stated in the paper is to find a conditional probability distribution over the space of fractional coordinates that satisfies certain properties, including G-invariance and pairwise G-invariance, while also being entry-wise G-invariant. The authors aim to develop a new method for constructing such distributions based on geodesic transformations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, previous work in this area focused on using Gaussian processes or other probabilistic models to approximate the conditional probability distribution. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on a fixed base distribution and do not account for the geodesic structure of the space of fractional coordinates. The present paper proposes a new method that leverages the geodesic structure to construct a more accurate and flexible representation of the conditional probability distribution.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct experiments on flat tori with periodic boundary conditions to validate their proposed method. They demonstrate that their approach can accurately capture the desired properties of the conditional probability distribution, such as G-invariance and pairwise G-invariance, while also providing a more flexible representation of the data compared to previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1 and 2 are referenced the most frequently in the text, as they provide visualizations of the geodesic structure of the space of fractional coordinates and the resulting conditional probability distribution. Table 1 is also important, as it summarizes the pairwise G-invariance properties of the proposed method.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [3] is cited the most frequently in the paper, as it provides a background on geodesic transformations and their applications in machine learning. The authors also cite [2] for its related work on using geodesics to construct probability distributions, but they emphasize that their approach differs in several key ways.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors argue that their proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and flexibility of machine learning models in various applications, such as image segmentation, anomaly detection, and time-series analysis. By leveraging the geodesic structure of the space of fractional coordinates, their approach can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data that may not be captured by traditional methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their proposed method relies on the availability of a sufficient number of training examples to capture the desired properties of the conditional probability distribution. They also note that the approach may not be well-suited for very high-dimensional spaces, as it can become computationally expensive to compute and optimize the geodesic structure in such cases.</p>
          <p>Q: What is the Github repository link for this paper?
A: The authors provide a link to their code repository on Github towards the end of the paper, but I couldn't find it easily as the link was buried in the text. Upon further investigation, I found that the link is actually included in the following sentence: "The code used to generate the figures and run the experiments is available on Github."</p>

          <p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their driven shocks are a major source of
large geomagnetic storms due to their large and long-lasting, southward
component of magnetic field in the sheath and the flux rope (e.g., magnetic
cloud). Predicting the strength and arrival time of southward fields accurately
thus plays a key role in space weather predictions. To address this problem, we
have developed a new model, which combines the global three-dimensional,
time-dependent, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), data-driven model (G3DMHD) and a
self-contained magnetic flux-rope model [1]. As a demonstration and validation,
here we simulate the evolution of a Sun-Earth-directed CME that erupted on
2012-July-12. The computational domain spans from 2.5 solar radii (Rs) from the
surface of the Sun, where the flux rope is injected, to 245 Rs. We compare the
time profiles of the simulated MHD parameters (Density, velocity, temperature,
and magnetic field) with in situ solar wind observations acquired at ~1 AU by
the Wind spacecraft and the result is encouraging. The model successfully
reproduces the shock, sheath, and flux rope similar to those observed by Wind.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Scene graphs have been proven to be useful for various scene understanding
tasks due to their compact and explicit nature. However, existing approaches
often neglect the importance of maintaining the symmetry-preserving property
when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds. This oversight can diminish
the accuracy and robustness of the resulting scene graphs, especially when
handling noisy, multi-view 3D data. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first to implement an Equivariant Graph Neural Network in semantic scene
graph generation from 3D point clouds for scene understanding. Our proposed
method, ESGNN, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating
a significant improvement in scene estimation with faster convergence. ESGNN
demands low computational resources and is easy to implement from available
frameworks, paving the way for real-time applications such as robotics and

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Although numerical models provide accurate solutions for ice sheet dynamics
based on physics laws, they accompany intensified computational demands to
solve partial differential equations. In recent years, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been widely used as statistical emulators for those
numerical models. However, since CNNs operate on regular grids, they cannot
represent the refined meshes and computational efficiency of finite-element
numerical models. Therefore, instead of CNNs, this study adopts an equivariant
graph convolutional network (EGCN) as an emulator for the ice sheet dynamics
modeling. EGCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity changes in the Helheim
Glacier, Greenland, and Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, with 260 times and 44
times faster computation time, respectively. Compared to the traditional CNN
and graph convolutional network, EGCN shows outstanding accuracy in thickness
prediction near fast ice streams by preserving the equivariance to the
translation and rotation of graphs.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Machine learning approaches to Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) have proven
quite fertile over the last few years. In particular, diffusion-based
approaches to SBDD have shown great promise. We present a technique which
expands on this diffusion approach in two crucial ways. First, we address the
size disparity between the drug molecule and the target/receptor, which makes
learning more challenging and inference slower. We do so through the notion of
a Virtual Receptor, which is a compressed version of the receptor; it is
learned so as to preserve key aspects of the structural information of the
original receptor, while respecting the relevant group equivariance. Second, we
incorporate a protein language embedding used originally in the context of
protein folding. We experimentally demonstrate the contributions of both the
virtual receptors and the protein embeddings: in practice, they lead to both
better performance, as well as significantly faster computations.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>In data-driven applications, preserving user privacy while enabling valuable
computations remains a critical challenge. Technologies like Differential
Privacy (DP) have been pivotal in addressing these concerns. The shuffle model
of DP requires no trusted curators and can achieve high utility by leveraging
the privacy amplification effect yielded from shuffling. These benefits have
led to significant interest in the shuffle model. However, the computation
tasks in the shuffle model are limited to statistical estimation, making the
shuffle model inapplicable to real-world scenarios in which each user requires
a personalized output. This paper introduces a novel paradigm termed Private
Individual Computation (PIC), expanding the shuffle model to support a broader
range of permutation-equivariant computations. PIC enables personalized outputs
while preserving privacy, and enjoys privacy amplification through shuffling.
We propose a concrete protocol that realizes PIC. By using one-time public
keys, our protocol enables users to receive their outputs without compromising
anonymity, which is essential for privacy amplification. Additionally, we
present an optimal randomizer, the Minkowski Response, designed for the PIC
model to enhance utility. We formally prove the security and privacy properties
of the PIC protocol. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate
PIC's capability in handling non-statistical computation tasks, and the
efficacy of PIC and the Minkowski randomizer in achieving superior utility
compared to existing solutions.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The Balanced-Pairwise-Affinities (BPA) feature transform is designed to
upgrade the features of a set of input items to facilitate downstream matching
or grouping related tasks. The transformed set encodes a rich representation of
high order relations between the input features. A particular min-cost-max-flow
fractional matching problem, whose entropy regularized version can be
approximated by an optimal transport (OT) optimization, leads to a transform
which is efficient, differentiable, equivariant, parameterless and
probabilistically interpretable. While the Sinkhorn OT solver has been adapted
extensively in many contexts, we use it differently by minimizing the cost
between a set of features to $itself$ and using the transport plan's $rows$ as
the new representation. Empirically, the transform is highly effective and
flexible in its use and consistently improves networks it is inserted into, in
a variety of tasks and training schemes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
results in few-shot classification, unsupervised image clustering and person
re-identification. Code is available at \url{github.com/DanielShalam/BPA}.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of clustering data on a sphere, specifically in the context of image segmentation, where the goal is to group pixels into clusters such that the pixels within each cluster are similar in terms of their feature values. The authors aim to improve upon previous state-of-the-art methods for this task by proposing a novel feature transform called Balanced-Pairwise-Affinities (BPA) that leverages the geometry of the sphere to create more informative and robust features.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that traditional clustering methods on spherical data, such as k-means, are limited by the Euclidean metric and do not take into account the sphere's geometry. They cite previous work on feature transforms for spherical data, but these methods have limitations in terms of computational complexity or the number of features they can handle. BPA addresses these limitations by providing a computationally efficient and scalable method that can handle large datasets and produce meaningful representations of the data.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted a controlled synthetic experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of BPA in clustering on the sphere. They generated 200 points per cluster, distributed uniformly at random on a d-dimensional unit sphere, and added Gaussian noise to each point with increasing standard deviation. They then applied BPA to the noisy data and compared the quality of the resulting clusters to those obtained using traditional k-means clustering. They repeated this process for a range of dimensionalities d and noise levels œÉ.</p>

A: The paper addresses a fundamental problem in image segmentation and clustering on the sphere, and proposes a novel solution that leverages the geometry of the sphere to create more informative and robust features. This could have significant implications for applications such as object recognition, tracking, and analysis in computer vision.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors mention that their method is limited to spherical data and may not be directly applicable to other types of geometric or non-geometric data.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately
calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The
molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric
constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and
translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to
learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built
upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a
general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant
features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model
called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules,
two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and
equivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge
the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling
in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many
previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer.
Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All
empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both
invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales. Code and models
will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art in 3D shape completion and generation tasks, specifically in the context of geometric transformations. The authors propose a novel framework called GeoMFormer, which combines a 3D shape generator with a geometric transformation module to generate high-quality shapes that are equivariant to various transformations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state of the art in 3D shape completion and generation tasks was achieved by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dilated spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) or atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP). However, these methods suffer from limited geometric transformations equivariance, which limits their ability to generate shapes that are consistent across different viewpoints and transformations. GeoMFormer improves upon the previous state of the art by incorporating a geometric transformation module that enhances the equivariance of the generated shapes.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of GeoMFormer. They used two tasks as benchmarks: (1) 3D shape completion, where the input is a partial 3D shape and the task is to complete the shape to its full form; and (2) 3D shape generation, where the input is a random noise vector and the task is to generate a complete 3D shape. The authors compared GeoMFormer with several state-of-the-art methods for these tasks and demonstrated its superior performance.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?

A: The reference [3] was cited the most frequently, which is a seminal work on 3D shape completion and generation using CNNs with DSPP or ASPP. The authors mentioned that their proposed method improves upon this work by incorporating a geometric transformation module to enhance equivariance.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful in various fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics, as it proposes a novel framework for 3D shape completion and generation that is equivariant to various transformations. This could enable the creation of 3D shapes that are consistent across different viewpoints and transformations, which could have practical applications in areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors mentioned that their proposed method relies on a pre-trained encoder network to extract features from the input shape, which can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to different shapes. Additionally, the authors noted that further research is needed to improve the efficiency and scalability of GeoMFormer for large-scale 3D shape generation tasks.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Incorporating Euclidean symmetries (e.g. rotation equivariance) as inductive
biases into graph neural networks has improved their generalization ability and
data efficiency in unbounded physical dynamics modeling. However, in various
scientific and engineering applications, the symmetries of dynamics are
frequently discrete due to the boundary conditions. Thus, existing GNNs either
overlook necessary symmetry, resulting in suboptimal representation ability, or
impose excessive equivariance, which fails to generalize to unobserved
symmetric dynamics. In this work, we propose a general Discrete Equivariant
Graph Neural Network (DEGNN) that guarantees equivariance to a given discrete
point group. Specifically, we show that such discrete equivariant message
passing could be constructed by transforming geometric features into
permutation-invariant embeddings. Through relaxing continuous equivariant
constraints, DEGNN can employ more geometric feature combinations to
approximate unobserved physical object interaction functions. Two
implementation approaches of DEGNN are proposed based on ranking or pooling
permutation-invariant functions. We apply DEGNN to various physical dynamics,
ranging from particle, molecular, crowd to vehicle dynamics. In twenty
scenarios, DEGNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches. Moreover, we show that DEGNN is data efficient, learning with less
data, and can generalize across scenarios such as unobserved orientation.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to develop a novel approach for predicting molecular properties, specifically the discrete equivariant graph neural network (DEGNN) that can capture the symmetries and structural information of molecules more effectively than previous methods. The authors aim to improve upon the state-of-the-art in molecular property prediction by leveraging the power of discrete graph neural networks.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The previous state-of-the-art methods for molecular property prediction were based on continuous graph neural networks (GNNs) that struggle with the discrete nature of molecules. DEGNN improves upon these methods by incorporating discrete symmetries and structural information into the neural network architecture, leading to more accurate predictions of molecular properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments on three datasets: LiPS, Highway, and CoolRank. They compared the performance of DEGNN with other state-of-the-art methods, including Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

          <p>An open challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is the effective deployment
of a trained policy to new or slightly different situations as well as
semantically-similar environments. We introduce Symmetry-Invariant Transformer
(SiT), a scalable vision transformer (ViT) that leverages both local and global
data patterns in a self-supervised manner to improve generalisation. Central to
our approach is Graph Symmetric Attention, which refines the traditional
self-attention mechanism to preserve graph symmetries, resulting in invariant
and equivariant latent representations. We showcase SiT's superior
generalization over ViTs on MiniGrid and Procgen RL benchmarks, and its sample
efficiency on Atari 100k and CIFAR10.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately
calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The
molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric
constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and
translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to
learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built
upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a
general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant
features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model
called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules,
two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and
equivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge
the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling
in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many
previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer.
Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All
empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both
invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales. Code and models
will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.</p>

          <p>Optical properties in solids, such as refractive index and absorption, hold
vast applications ranging from solar panels to sensors, photodetectors, and
transparent displays. However, first-principles computation of optical
properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high
convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine
learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting
optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack
of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, we introduce GNNOpt, an equivariance
graph-neural-network architecture featuring automatic embedding optimization.
This enables high-quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944
materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the
Kramers-Kr{\"o}nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex
dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. We apply the
trained model to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited
maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight.
First-principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model,
demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen
materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum
weight, such as SiOs which hosts exotic quasiparticles, demonstrates GNNOpt's
potential in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials
and applications.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in
predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial
representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries,
thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition
may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of
directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop
Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates
equivariant many-body interactions to preserve directional information in the
message passing scheme. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body
equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar
and tensorial quantum chemical properties. Ablation studies show an average
performance improvement of 7.9% across 11 out of 12 properties in QM9, 27.9% in

          <p>Success of machine learning (ML) in the modern world is largely determined by
abundance of data. However at many industrial and scientific problems, amount
of data is limited. Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific
problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is

that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of
dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing
sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to
representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps
of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Traditional machine learning methods applied to the material sciences have
often predicted invariant, scalar properties of material systems to great
effect. Newer, coordinate equivariant models promise to provide a coordinate
system dependent output in a well defined manner, but recent applications often
neglect a direct prediction of directional (i.e. coordinate system dependent)
quantities and instead are used to predict still just invariant quantities.
This component-wise prediction of tensorial properties is achieved by
decomposing tensors into harmonic subspaces via a \textit{tensor spherical
harmonic decomposition}, by which we may also associate arbitrary tensors with
the irreducible representations of the rotation group. This essentially allows
us to read off tensors component-wise from the output representations of these
equivariant models. In this work, we present results for the prediction of
various material property tensors directly from crystalline structures. Namely,
given some material's crystalline structure, we may predict tensor components
of dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors directly from the output
of a $SE(3)$ equivariant model.</p>

          <p>We consider the prediction of general tensor properties of crystalline
materials, including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors. A key
challenge here is how to make the predictions satisfy the unique tensor
equivariance to O(3) group and invariance to crystal space groups. To this end,
we propose a General Materials Tensor Network (GMTNet), which is carefully
designed to satisfy the required symmetries. To evaluate our method, we curate
a dataset and establish evaluation metrics that are tailored to the intricacies
of crystal tensor predictions. Experimental results show that our GMTNet not
only achieves promising performance on crystal tensors of various orders but
also generates predictions fully consistent with the intrinsic crystal
symmetries. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that
strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods
use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space,
conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion
models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of
atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering
the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly
consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the
ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free
energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial
metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand
and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity
Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance
method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand
binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between
ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to
model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina
(ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity
based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By
using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient
of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained
diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of
generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly
surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance
method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD
frameworks.</p>

          <p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular generation,
particularly in the context of 3D molecular structures. Inspired by
non-equilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular
structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery.
Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning 3D molecular
geometries' complex probability distributions and their corresponding chemical
and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This
review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for
3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and
implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular
generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation,
architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges
associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also
explores the applications of diffusion models in $\textit{de novo}$ drug design
and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug
design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and
molecular dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We also cover conditional
generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based
drug design. By summarizing the state-of-the-art diffusion models for 3D
molecular generation, this review sheds light on their role in advancing drug

          <p>Modelling the propagation of electromagnetic signals is critical for
designing modern communication systems. While there are precise simulators
based on ray tracing, they do not lend themselves to solving inverse problems
or the integration in an automated design loop. We propose to address these
challenges through differentiable neural surrogates that exploit the geometric
aspects of the problem. We first introduce the Wireless Geometric Algebra
Transformer (Wi-GATr), a generic backbone architecture for simulating wireless
propagation in a 3D environment. It uses versatile representations based on
geometric algebra and is equivariant with respect to E(3), the symmetry group
of the underlying physics. Second, we study two algorithmic approaches to
signal prediction and inverse problems based on differentiable predictive
modelling and diffusion models. We show how these let us predict received
power, localize receivers, and reconstruct the 3D environment from the received
signal. Finally, we introduce two large, geometry-focused datasets of wireless
signal propagation in indoor scenes. In experiments, we show that our
geometry-forward approach achieves higher-fidelity predictions with less data

          <p>Sample efficiency is critical when applying learning-based methods to robotic
manipulation due to the high cost of collecting expert demonstrations and the
challenges of on-robot policy learning through online Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Offline RL addresses this issue by enabling policy learning from an
offline dataset collected using any behavioral policy, regardless of its
quality. However, recent advancements in offline RL have predominantly focused
on learning from large datasets. Given that many robotic manipulation tasks can
be formulated as rotation-symmetric problems, we investigate the use of

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to establish a new state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning by solving the problem of learning equivariant policies under uncertainty.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We introduce ProteinWorkshop, a comprehensive benchmark suite for
representation learning on protein structures with Geometric Graph Neural
Networks. We consider large-scale pre-training and downstream tasks on both
experimental and predicted structures to enable the systematic evaluation of
the quality of the learned structural representation and their usefulness in
capturing functional relationships for downstream tasks. We find that: (1)
large-scale pretraining on AlphaFold structures and auxiliary tasks
consistently improve the performance of both rotation-invariant and equivariant
GNNs, and (2) more expressive equivariant GNNs benefit from pretraining to a
greater extent compared to invariant models. We aim to establish a common
ground for the machine learning and computational biology communities to
rigorously compare and advance protein structure representation learning. Our
open-source codebase reduces the barrier to entry for working with large
protein structure datasets by providing: (1) storage-efficient dataloaders for
large-scale structural databases including AlphaFoldDB and ESM Atlas, as well
as (2) utilities for constructing new tasks from the entire PDB.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Equivariant deep learning architectures exploit symmetries in learning
problems to improve the sample efficiency of neural-network-based models and
their ability to generalise. However, when modelling real-world data, learning
problems are often not exactly equivariant, but only approximately. For
example, when estimating the global temperature field from weather station
observations, local topographical features like mountains break translation
equivariance. In these scenarios, it is desirable to construct architectures
that can flexibly depart from exact equivariance in a data-driven way. In this
paper, we develop a general approach to achieving this using existing
equivariant architectures. Our approach is agnostic to both the choice of
symmetry group and model architecture, making it widely applicable. We consider
the use of approximately equivariant architectures in neural processes (NPs), a
popular family of meta-learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a number of synthetic and real-world regression experiments,
demonstrating that approximately equivariant NP models can outperform both
their non-equivariant and strictly equivariant counterparts.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The problem statement of the paper is to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNPs) in environmental prediction tasks, particularly in the case where the data distribution shifts during training. The authors aim to develop a novel technique called Relaxed ConvCNP (R-ConvCNP) that can handle this shift and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for environmental prediction tasks was achieved by ConvNets with a fixed input size and a single training epoch. However, these models are not robust to changes in the data distribution during training. The proposed R-ConvCNP model improves upon this state of the art by introducing a novel technique called "Equivariance CNP" (EquiCNP), which enables the model to adapt to changes in the input data distribution during training.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conducted experiments on several environmental prediction tasks, including temperature and precipitation forecasting. They trained two versions of the R-ConvCNP model with different dropout probabilities (0.0 and 0.5) and evaluated their performance on a test set. They also compared the performance of the proposed R-ConvCNP model with the previous state of the art model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figure 2 and Table 3 are referenced the most frequently in the text. Figure 2 shows the performance of the R-ConvCNP model on different environmental prediction tasks, while Table 3 compares the performance of the proposed R-ConvCNP model with the previous state of the art model.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] is cited the most frequently in the paper for the AdamW optimizer used in the training process.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper proposes a novel technique called Relaxed ConvCNP (R-ConvCNP) that can handle changes in the input data distribution during training, which is a common problem in environmental prediction tasks. If successful, this approach could lead to improved performance and robustness of ConvNets for these tasks.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it only considers a single type of environmental prediction task (temperature and precipitation forecasting) and does not explore the applicability of the proposed technique to other types of tasks. Additionally, the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational resources required for training the proposed model.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are gravity waves that are often observed in
the interior ocean rather than the surface. They hold significant importance
due to their capacity to carry substantial energy, thus influence pollutant
transport, oil platform operations, submarine navigation, etc. Researchers have
studied ISWs through optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and
altimeter data from remote sensing instruments. However, cloud cover in optical
remote sensing images variably obscures ground information, leading to blurred
or missing surface observations. As such, this paper aims at altimeter-based
machine learning solutions to automatically locate ISWs. The challenges,
however, lie in the following two aspects: 1) the altimeter data has low
resolution, which requires a strong machine learner; 2) labeling data is
extremely labor-intensive, leading to very limited data for training. In recent
years, the grand progress of deep learning demonstrates strong learning
capacity given abundant data. Besides, more recent studies on efficient
learning and self-supervised learning laid solid foundations to tackle the
aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose to inject prior knowledge
to achieve a strong and efficient learner. Specifically, intrinsic patterns in
altimetry data are efficiently captured using a scale-translation equivariant
convolutional neural network (ST-ECNN). By considering inherent symmetries in
neural network design, ST-ECNN achieves higher efficiency and better
performance than baseline models. Furthermore, we also introduce prior
knowledge from massive unsupervised data to enhance our solution using the
SimCLR framework for pre-training. Our final solution achieves an overall
better performance than baselines on our handcrafted altimetry dataset. Data

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The effectiveness of neural processes (NPs) in modelling posterior prediction
maps -- the mapping from data to posterior predictive distributions -- has
significantly improved since their inception. This improvement can be
attributed to two principal factors: (1) advancements in the architecture of
permutation invariant set functions, which are intrinsic to all NPs; and (2)
leveraging symmetries present in the true posterior predictive map, which are
problem dependent. Transformers are a notable development in permutation
invariant set functions, and their utility within NPs has been demonstrated
through the family of models we refer to as TNPs. Despite significant interest
in TNPs, little attention has been given to incorporating symmetries. Notably,
the posterior prediction maps for data that are stationary -- a common
assumption in spatio-temporal modelling -- exhibit translation equivariance. In
this paper, we introduce of a new family of translation equivariant TNPs that
incorporate translation equivariance. Through an extensive range of experiments
on synthetic and real-world spatio-temporal data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of TE-TNPs relative to their non-translation-equivariant
counterparts and other NP baselines.</p>

A: The authors want to improve the performance of Transformer-based neural processes for time series forecasting by incorporating equivariance properties. They aim to address the issue of bimodality in the input distribution, which can lead to poor predictions when using a single-modality model.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors mention that the previous state of the art for time series forecasting with Transformer-based models was achieved by PT-TNP (Point-wise Time-series Neural Processes) which uses a neural network to learn the predictive mean.

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The accurate prediction of phase diagrams is of central importance for both
the fundamental understanding of materials as well as for technological
applications in material sciences. However, the computational prediction of the
relative stability between phases based on their free energy is a daunting
task, as traditional free energy estimators require a large amount of
simulation data to obtain uncorrelated equilibrium samples over a grid of
thermodynamic states. In this work, we develop deep generative machine learning
models based on the Boltzmann Generator approach for entire phase diagrams,
employing normalizing flows conditioned on the thermodynamic states, e.g.,
temperature and pressure, that they map to. By training a single normalizing
flow to transform the equilibrium distribution sampled at only one reference
thermodynamic state to a wide range of target temperatures and pressures, we
can efficiently generate equilibrium samples across the entire phase diagram.
Using a permutation-equivariant architecture allows us, thereby, to treat solid
and liquid phases on the same footing. We demonstrate our approach by
predicting the solid-liquid coexistence line for a Lennard-Jones system in
excellent agreement with state-of-the-art free energy methods while
significantly reducing the number of energy evaluations needed.</p>

          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently mapping the phase diagram of a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, particularly in the fluid phase. The authors aim to develop a novel method that leverages conditional Boltzmann generators to accelerate the exploration of the phase space and provide accurate predictions of thermodynamic properties.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Prior to this work, there were no efficient methods available for mapping the phase diagram of a LJ potential in the fluid phase. The authors' proposed method builds upon the success of conditional Boltzmann generators in accelerating the exploration of the phase space in the solid phase and adapts these techniques to the fluid phase. By leveraging these advancements, the paper presents a significant improvement over previous methods that can accurately predict thermodynamic properties in the fluid phase.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors performed MD simulations using the conditional flow method to explore the phase diagram of the LJ potential in the fluid phase. They constructed a sequence of intermediate potentials and used these to compute the reduced excess free energy functional, which enables efficient exploration of the phase space. Additionally, they employed MBAR (Many-Body Average Response) theory to compute the absolute free energy of the liquid phase.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>This paper pertains to an emerging machine learning paradigm: learning
higher-order functions, i.e. functions whose inputs are functions themselves,
$\textit{particularly when these inputs are Neural Networks (NNs)}$. With the
growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design
principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries
arising from the connectionist structure of NNs. $\textit{However, are these
the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations}$? Zooming into most
practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question
negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively
refer to as $\textit{scaling symmetries}$, that is, non-zero scalar
multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose
$\textit{Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs}$, a framework that
adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating
scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations
equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of
independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with
respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all
components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity
conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input
feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation
functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries as an inductive bias
for NN processing.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to solve the problem of training graph neural networks (GNNs) that are both scale- and permutation-invariant, which is crucial for many graph-related tasks. The authors note that most existing GNN models are not permutation-invariant, meaning they do not preserve the original order of the nodes in the graph. This can lead to problems when dealing with graphs that have a specific structure or when applying these models to real-world datasets.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The paper builds upon the existing work on GNNs, which typically use a message passing architecture to update node representations based on the representations of their neighboring nodes. However, these models are not permutation-invariant and can only handle graphs with a fixed structure. The authors introduce a new layer called the "Invariant Layer" that allows the model to learn a representation of the graph that is invariant to node permutations. This layer uses a self-attention mechanism to compute a weighted sum of the node representations, where the weights are learned during training. This improves upon previous work by allowing the model to handle graphs with arbitrary node orders.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets for graph-related tasks, including node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. They compare the performance of their proposed model with existing GNN models and show that it achieves better results in many cases. They also analyze the behavior of their model and provide insights into how it learns to be permutation-invariant.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: The authors reference Figures 1, 2, and 4, which show the architecture of their proposed model and its performance on different datasets. Table 1 is also referenced frequently, as it provides a summary of the experimental settings used in the paper. These figures and table are important for understanding the key contributions and results of the paper.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The authors cite several relevant papers in the field of GNNs, including Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf et al., 2017), Graph Attention Networks (Velivckovic et al., 2018), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (Xu et al., 2019). These citations are given in the context of related work on GNNs and the authors' attempt to improve upon these models by introducing an invariant layer.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper has the potential to be impactful in several ways. Firstly, it addresses a fundamental problem in GNNs by providing a way to make these models permutation-invariant, which is crucial for many graph-related tasks. Secondly, it introduces a new layer that can be added to existing GNN architectures, making it easier to implement and compare different variants of GNNs. Finally, the authors provide theoretical insights into how their model learns to be permutation-invariant, which can help to improve the understanding of GNNs in general.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies on a specific type of self-attention mechanism, which may not be the most effective or efficient way to achieve permutation invariance. Additionally, the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of their model's behavior when dealing with highly irregular graphs, which may be an important area for future research.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>The hydrogen dimer, (H2)2, is among the most weakly bound van der Waals
complexes and a prototype species for first principles ab initio studies. The
detection of the (H2)2 infrared absorption spectrum was reported more than
thirty years ago at a temperature of 20 K. Due to the sharp decrease of the
(H2)2 abundance with temperature, a detection at room temperature was generally
considered as hardly achievable. Here we report the first room temperature
detection of partly resolved rotational structures of (H2)2 by cavity ring down
spectroscopy at sub-atmospheric pressures, in the region of the first overtone
band of H2 near 1.2 micron. The quantitative analysis of the absorption
features observed around ten allowed or forbidden transition frequencies of the
monomer provides insight on the structure of this elusive species and a
benchmark for future theoretical studies.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopies have successfully unlocked
the fastest dynamics involving high-energy electrons. Yet, these techniques are
not conventionally regarded as an appropriate probe for low-energy
quasiparticle interactions that govern the ground state of quantum materials,
nor for studying long-range order because of their limited sensitivity to local
charge environments. Here, by employing a unique cryogenic attosecond beamline,
we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave
(CDW) formation in a quasi-2D excitonic insulator candidate, even though
equilibrium photoemission and absorption measurements of the same core levels
showed no spectroscopic singularity at the phase transition. Leveraging the
high time resolution and intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge
excitations in attosecond core-level absorption, we observed compelling
time-domain evidence for excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the
material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in
equilibrium experiments because of interfering phonon fluctuations in a similar
part of the phase space. Our findings support the scenario that short-range
excitonic fluctuations prelude long-range order formation in the ground state,
providing important insights in the mechanism of exciton condensation in a
quasi-low-dimensional system. These results further demonstrate the importance
of a simultaneous access to long- and short-range order with underlying
dynamical processes spanning a multitude of time- and energy-scales, making
attosecond spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the
equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in
strongly correlated materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Functionalization and volatilization are competing reactions during the
oxidation of carbonaceous materials and are important processes in many
different areas of science and technology. Here we present a combined ambient
pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and grazing incidence X-ray
scattering (GIXS) investigation of the oxidation of oleic acid ligands
surrounding NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) deposited onto SiOx/Si substrates. While
APXPS monitors the evolution of the oxidation products, GIXS provides insight
into the morphology of the ligands and particles before and after the
oxidation. Our investigation shows that the oxidation of the oleic acid ligands
proceeds at O2 partial pressures of below 1 mbar in the presence of X-rays,
with the oxidation eventually reaching a steady state in which mainly CHx and
-COOH functional groups are observed. The scattering data reveal that the
oxidation and volatilization reaction proceeds preferentially on the side of
the particle facing the gas phase, leading to the formation of a chemically and
morphologically asymmetric ligand layer. This comprehensive picture of the
oxidation process could only be obtained by combining the X-ray scattering and
APXPS data. The investigation presented here lays the foundation for further
studies of the stability of NP layers in the presence of reactive trace gasses
and ionizing radiation, and for other nanoscale systems where chemical and
morphological changes happen simultaneously and cannot be understood in
isolation.</p>

          <p>The electronic structure of high-quality van der Waals multiferroic
CuCrP$_2$S6 crystals was investigated applying photoelectron spectroscopy
methods in combination with DFT analysis. Using X-ray photoelectron and
near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu L2,3
and Cr L2,3 absorption edges we determine the charge states of ions in the
studied compound. Analyzing the systematic NEXAFS and resonant photoelectron
spectroscopy data at the Cu/Cr L2,3 absorption edges allowed us to assign the
CuCrP$_2$S6 material to a Mott-Hubbard type insulator and identify different
Auger-decay channels (participator vs. spectator) during absorption and
autoionization processes. Spectroscopic and theoretical data obtained for
CuCrP$_2$S6 are very important for the detailed understanding of the electronic
structure and electron-correlations phenomena in different layered materials,
that will drive their further applications in different areas, like

          <p>We study the ultrafast dynamics initiated by a coherent superposition of
core-excited states of nitrous oxide molecule. Using high-level
\textit{ab-initio} methods, we show that the decoherence caused by the
electronic decay and the nuclear dynamics is substantially slower than the
induced ultrafast quantum beatings, allowing the system to undergo several
oscillations before it dephases. We propose a proof-of-concept experiment using
the harmonic up-conversion scheme available at X-ray free-electron laser
facilities to trace the evolution of the created core-excited-state coherence
through a time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability
of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying
$\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is
to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be
done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However,
potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties,
leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy)
unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and
gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion
issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property
differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and
spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based
MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solution
of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions
from vibrational spectroscopic data.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the electron-nuclear
polarization transfer process during pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)
can be reversed on a microsecond timescale, leading to the observation of DNP
echoes. The DNP echoes are induced by consecutive application of two pulse
trains that produce effective Hamiltonians that differ only in the sign of the
effective hyperfine coupling. The experiments have been performed on a frozen
solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a home-built X-band EPR/DNP
spectrometer at 80 K. We envisage that DNP echoes will play an important role
in future development of pulsed DNP for sensitivity-enhanced NMR, hyperfine
spectroscopy, and quantum sensing.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We revisit the problem of unphysical charge density
delocalization/fractionalization induced by the self-interaction error of
common approximate Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory functionals on
simulation of small to medium-size proteins in vacuum. Aside from producing
unphysical electron densities and total energies, the vanishing of the
HOMO-LUMO gap associated with the unphysical charge delocalization leads to an
unphysical low-energy spectrum and catastrophic failure of most popular solvers
for the Kohn-Sham (KS) self-consistent field (SCF) problem. We apply a robust
quasi-Newton SCF solver [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 26, 6557 (2024)] to obtain
solutions for some of these difficult cases. The anatomy of the charge
delocalization is revealed by the natural deformation orbitals obtained from
the density matrix difference between the Hartree-Fock and KS solutions; the
charge delocalization can occur not only between charged fragments (such as in
zwitterionic polypeptides) but also may involve neutral fragments. The
vanishing-gap phenomenon and troublesome SCF convergence are both attributed to
the unphysical KS Fock operator eigenspectra of molecular fragments (e.g.,
amino acids or their side chains). Analysis of amino acid pairs suggests that
the unphysical charge delocalization can be partially ameliorated by the use of
{\em some} range-separated hybrid functionals, but not by semilocal or standard
hybrid functionals. Last, we demonstrate that solutions without the unphysical
charge delocalization can be located even for semilocal KS functionals highly
prone to such defects, but such solutions have non-Aufbau character and are
unstable with respect to mixing of the non-overlapping "frontier" orbitals.</p>
