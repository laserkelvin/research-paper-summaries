          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well
motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by
precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have
distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus,
they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular
scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy
of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics
sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can
be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral
spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for
time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a
complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such
hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The authors aim to develop a new method for calculating electron spin-rotation tensors using first-principles calculations. They seek to improve upon existing methods, which are limited by their reliance on approximate expressions or numerical calculations.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: The authors build upon previous work that used approximate expressions or numerical calculations to calculate electron spin-rotation tensors. They introduce a new method based on first-principles calculations, which provides more accurate results than previous methods.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The authors perform first-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate electron spin-rotation tensors for various molecules. They test their method on a variety of systems and compare their results to experimental data where available.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 1, 3, and 5 are referenced frequently throughout the paper, as they illustrate the performance of the new method compared to previous methods. Table 1 is also important, as it summarizes the results of the calculations for different molecules.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference [88] by Szalay et al. is cited several times throughout the paper, as it provides a basis set for correlated wave functions that are used in the new method. The reference [90] by Curtiss et al. is also cited frequently, as it discusses the extension of Gaussian-2 theory to molecules containing third-row atoms.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The authors' new method for calculating electron spin-rotation tensors has the potential to significantly improve upon existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This could have important implications for a wide range of applications, including chemistry, physics, and materials science.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The authors acknowledge that their method is limited to systems with up to 100 atoms and may not be applicable to larger systems. They also note that further development and validation of their method is needed to fully establish its accuracy and robustness.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>
