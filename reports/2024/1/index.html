          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on
their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the
use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to
traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work, we generate
a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The
dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of
methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order
tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this
dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii)
consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare
the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and
demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced
training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the
model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed
are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical
tensor etc.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper investigates the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) when incorporating different types of graphs for message passing, specifically line graphs, and compares them to other models. They aim to answer how different choices of graphs affect the performance of GNNs.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for training GNNs on highly-symmetric lattices was the mCGCNN model proposed by Meyer et al. (2022), which used a combination of the primal and dual graphs for message passing. The current paper improves upon this by experimenting with different types of graphs, including line graphs, and investigating their impact on GNN performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper conducts several experiments to compare the performance of GNNs when using different types of graphs for message passing. They train various models, such as CGCNN, mCGCNN, dual, and line graph-based models, and evaluate their performance on a dataset of highly-symmetric lattices.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 7 and 8 are referenced the most frequently in the paper, as they provide visual representations of the results obtained from the experiments. Figure 7 shows the unit cell of a simple cubic lattice and the true stiffness surface, while Figure 8 compares the performance of different models in the x-y plane. Table 8 is also important, as it summarizes the results of the experiments conducted.</p>
          <p>Q: Which references were cited the most frequently? Under what context were the citations given in?
A: The reference cited the most frequently in the paper is Geiger et al. (2022), which provides the software implementation of the e3nn model used in the experiments. The reference is cited in the context of describing the mCGCNN model and the different types of graphs used for message passing.</p>
          <p>Q: Why is the paper potentially impactful or important?
A: The paper contributes to the field of GNNs by providing insights into the choice of graphs for message passing and their impact on performance. By investigating the effectiveness of different types of graphs, the paper can help guide future research in this area and lead to more efficient and accurate GNN models.</p>
          <p>Q: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?
A: The paper does not consider the line graph to be a significant improvement over the primal graph for message passing, as it empirically shows that incorporating the line graph does not provide any benefit in terms of performance. However, this conclusion may be limited by the specific dataset and model architecture used in the experiments.</p>
          <p>Q: Is a link to the Github code provided? If there isn't or you are unsure, say you don't know.
A: No link to a Github code is provided in the paper.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning (DL) models have now been widely used for high-performance
material property prediction for properties such as formation energy and band
gap. However, training such DL models usually requires a large amount of
labeled data, which is usually not available for most materials properties such
as exfoliation energy and elastic properties. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods have been proposed to address this data scarcity issue by learning
inherent representations from unlabeled data in various research fields.
Herein, we present DSSL, a physics-guided Dual SSL framework, for graph neural
networks (GNNs) based material property prediction. This hybrid framework
combines node-masking based predictive SSL with atomic coordinate perturbation
based contrastive SSL strategies, allowing it to learn structural embeddings
that capture both local and global information of input crystals. Especially,
we propose to use predicting the macroproperty (e.g. elasticity) related
microproperty such as atomic stiffness as an additional pretext task to achieve
physics-guided pretraining process. We pretrain our DSSL model on the Materials
Project database with unlabeled data and finetune it with ten extra datasets
with different material properties. The experimental results demonstrate that
teaching neural networks some physics using the SSL strategy can bring up to
26.89\% performance improvement compared to the baseline GNN models. Our source
code is now freely available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/DSSL</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Many important processes affecting the Earth's climate are determined by the
physical properties of seawater. Desalination of seawater is a significant
source of drinking wate.Since the physical properties of seawater governing
these processes depend on the molecular interactions among its components, a
deeper knowledge of seawater at the molecular level is needed. However MD
studies reporting the physical properties of seawater are currently lacking.
This is probably due to the usual perception of the seawater composition being
too complex to approach.This point of view ignores the fact that physical
properties of seawater are dependent on a single parameter representing the
composition, namely the salinity. This is because the relative proportions of
any two major constituents of seasalt are always the same. An obstacle to
performing MD simulations of seawater could have been the unavailability of a
satisfactory force field representing the interactions between water molecules
and dissolved substances. This drawback has recently been overcome with the
proposal of the Madrid-2019 FF.Here we show for the first time that MD
simulations of seawater are feasible. We have performed MD simulations of a
system, the composition of which is close to the average composition of
standard seawater and with the molecular interactions given by the Madrid-2019
force field. We are able to provide quantitative or semiquantitative
predictions for a number of relevant physical properties of seawater for
temperatures and salinities from the oceanographic range to those relevant to
desalination processes. The computed magnitudes include static (density),
dynamical (viscosity and diffusion coefficients), structural (ionic hydration,
ion-ion distribution functions) and interfacial (surface tension) properties.</p>

          <p>Understanding the irregular variation of the solar cycle is crucial due to
its significant impact on global climates and the heliosphere. Since the polar
magnetic field determines the amplitude of the next solar cycle, variations in
the polar field can lead to fluctuations in the solar cycle. We have explored
the variability of the solar cycle at different levels of dynamo
supercriticality. We observe that the variability depends on the dynamo
operation regime, with the near-critical regime exhibiting more variability
than the supercritical regime. Furthermore, we have explored the effects of the
irregular BMR properties (emergence rate, latitude, tilt, and flux) on the
polar field and the solar cycle. We find that they all produce considerable
variation in the solar cycle; however, the variation due to the tilt scatter is
the largest.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Multi-spacecraft observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events not
only enable a deeper understanding and development of particle acceleration and
transport theories, but also provide important constraints for model validation
efforts. However, because of computational limitations, a given physics-based
SEP model is usually best-suited to capture a particular phase of an SEP event,
rather than its whole development from onset through decay. For example,
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere often incorporate solar
transients only at the outer boundary of their so-called coronal domain --
usually set at a heliocentric distance of 20-30 $R_{\odot}$. This means that
particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is also computed from this boundary
onwards, leading to simulated SEP event onsets that can be many hours later
than observed, since shock waves can form much lower in the solar corona. In
this work, we aim to improve the modelled onset of SEP events by inserting a
"fixed source" of particle injection at the outer boundary of the coronal
domain of the coupled WSA-Enlil 3D MHD model of the heliosphere. The SEP model
that we employ for this effort is SEPMOD, a physics-based test-particle code
based on a field line tracer and adiabatic invariant conservation. We apply our
initial tests and results of SEPMOD's fixed-source option to the 2021 October 9
SEP event, which was detected at five well-separated locations in the inner
heliosphere -- Parker Solar Probe, STEREO-A, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and
near-Earth spacecraft.</p>
