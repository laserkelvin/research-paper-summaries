          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on
their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the
use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to
traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work, we generate
a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The
dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of
methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order
tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this
dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii)
consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare
the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and
demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced
training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the
model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed
are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical
tensor etc.</p>

          <h3>LLM summary</h3>
          <p>Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper investigates the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) when incorporating different types of graphs for message passing, specifically line graphs, and compares them to other models. They aim to answer how different choices of graphs affect the performance of GNNs.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: According to the paper, the previous state of the art for training GNNs on highly-symmetric lattices was the mCGCNN model proposed by Meyer et al. (2022), which used a combination of the primal and dual graphs for message passing. The current paper improves upon this by experimenting with different types of graphs, including line graphs, and investigating their impact on GNN performance.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper conducts several experiments to compare the performance of GNNs when using different types of graphs for message passing. They train various models, such as CGCNN, mCGCNN, dual, and line graph-based models, and evaluate their performance on a dataset of highly-symmetric lattices.</p>
          <p>Q: Which figures and tables were referenced in the text most frequently, and/or are the most important for the paper?
A: Figures 7 and 8 are referenced the most frequently in the paper, as they provide visual representations of the results obtained from the experiments. Figure 7 shows the unit cell of a simple cubic lattice and the true stiffness surface, while Figure 8 compares the performance of different models in the x-y plane. Table 8 is also important, as it summarizes the results of the experiments conducted.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Deep learning (DL) models have now been widely used for high-performance
material property prediction for properties such as formation energy and band
gap. However, training such DL models usually requires a large amount of
labeled data, which is usually not available for most materials properties such
as exfoliation energy and elastic properties. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods have been proposed to address this data scarcity issue by learning
inherent representations from unlabeled data in various research fields.
Herein, we present DSSL, a physics-guided Dual SSL framework, for graph neural
networks (GNNs) based material property prediction. This hybrid framework
combines node-masking based predictive SSL with atomic coordinate perturbation
based contrastive SSL strategies, allowing it to learn structural embeddings
that capture both local and global information of input crystals. Especially,
we propose to use predicting the macroproperty (e.g. elasticity) related
microproperty such as atomic stiffness as an additional pretext task to achieve
physics-guided pretraining process. We pretrain our DSSL model on the Materials
Project database with unlabeled data and finetune it with ten extra datasets
with different material properties. The experimental results demonstrate that
teaching neural networks some physics using the SSL strategy can bring up to
26.89\% performance improvement compared to the baseline GNN models. Our source
code is now freely available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/DSSL</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Many important processes affecting the Earth's climate are determined by the
physical properties of seawater. Desalination of seawater is a significant
source of drinking wate.Since the physical properties of seawater governing
these processes depend on the molecular interactions among its components, a
deeper knowledge of seawater at the molecular level is needed. However MD
studies reporting the physical properties of seawater are currently lacking.
This is probably due to the usual perception of the seawater composition being
too complex to approach.This point of view ignores the fact that physical
properties of seawater are dependent on a single parameter representing the
composition, namely the salinity. This is because the relative proportions of
any two major constituents of seasalt are always the same. An obstacle to
performing MD simulations of seawater could have been the unavailability of a
satisfactory force field representing the interactions between water molecules
and dissolved substances. This drawback has recently been overcome with the
proposal of the Madrid-2019 FF.Here we show for the first time that MD
simulations of seawater are feasible. We have performed MD simulations of a
system, the composition of which is close to the average composition of
standard seawater and with the molecular interactions given by the Madrid-2019
force field. We are able to provide quantitative or semiquantitative
predictions for a number of relevant physical properties of seawater for
temperatures and salinities from the oceanographic range to those relevant to
desalination processes. The computed magnitudes include static (density),
dynamical (viscosity and diffusion coefficients), structural (ionic hydration,
ion-ion distribution functions) and interfacial (surface tension) properties.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Understanding the irregular variation of the solar cycle is crucial due to
its significant impact on global climates and the heliosphere. Since the polar
magnetic field determines the amplitude of the next solar cycle, variations in
the polar field can lead to fluctuations in the solar cycle. We have explored
the variability of the solar cycle at different levels of dynamo
supercriticality. We observe that the variability depends on the dynamo
operation regime, with the near-critical regime exhibiting more variability
than the supercritical regime. Furthermore, we have explored the effects of the
irregular BMR properties (emergence rate, latitude, tilt, and flux) on the
polar field and the solar cycle. We find that they all produce considerable
variation in the solar cycle; however, the variation due to the tilt scatter is
the largest.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Multi-spacecraft observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events not
only enable a deeper understanding and development of particle acceleration and
transport theories, but also provide important constraints for model validation
efforts. However, because of computational limitations, a given physics-based
SEP model is usually best-suited to capture a particular phase of an SEP event,
rather than its whole development from onset through decay. For example,
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere often incorporate solar
transients only at the outer boundary of their so-called coronal domain --
usually set at a heliocentric distance of 20-30 $R_{\odot}$. This means that
particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is also computed from this boundary
onwards, leading to simulated SEP event onsets that can be many hours later
than observed, since shock waves can form much lower in the solar corona. In
this work, we aim to improve the modelled onset of SEP events by inserting a
"fixed source" of particle injection at the outer boundary of the coronal
domain of the coupled WSA-Enlil 3D MHD model of the heliosphere. The SEP model
that we employ for this effort is SEPMOD, a physics-based test-particle code
based on a field line tracer and adiabatic invariant conservation. We apply our
initial tests and results of SEPMOD's fixed-source option to the 2021 October 9
SEP event, which was detected at five well-separated locations in the inner
heliosphere -- Parker Solar Probe, STEREO-A, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and
near-Earth spacecraft.</p>

Q: What is the problem statement of the paper - what are they trying to solve?
A: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of solar energetic particle (SEP) event onsets using a new method called SEPMOD. The current methods for estimating SEP event onsets have limitations, such as relying on incomplete and uncertain data, which can result in inaccurate onset times.</p>
          <p>Q: What was the previous state of the art? How did this paper improve upon it?
A: Previous studies have used various methods to estimate SEP event onsets, but these methods have limitations and uncertainties. The current paper proposes a new method called SEPMOD, which improves upon the previous state of the art by incorporating additional data sources and using a more sophisticated statistical analysis technique.</p>
          <p>Q: What were the experiments proposed and carried out?
A: The paper presents several experiments to evaluate the performance of the SEPMOD method. These experiments involve comparing the estimated onset times from SEPMOD with the actual onset times obtained from in-situ observations and other independent data sources.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>We report the first interstellar identification of protonated acetylene,
C2H3+, a fundamental hydrocarbon, in the z=0.89 molecular absorber toward the
gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. The molecular species is identified
from clear absorption features corresponding to the 2_12-1_01 (rest frequency
494.034 GHz) and 1_11-0_00 (431.316 GHz) ground-state transitions of ortho and
para forms of C2H3+, respectively, in ALMA spectra toward the southwestern
image of PKS1830-211, where numerous molecules, including other hydrocarbons,
have already been detected. From the simple assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) with cosmic microwave background photons and an ortho-to-para
ratio of three, we estimate a total C2H3+ column density of 2 x 10^12 cm^-2 and
an abundance of 10^-10 compared to H_2. However, formation pumping could affect
the population of metastable states, yielding a C2H3+ column density higher
than the LTE value by a factor of a few. We explore possible routes to the
formation of C2H3+, mainly connected to acetylene and methane, and find that

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Crystal structure prediction (CSP) has made significant progress, but most
methods focus on unconditional generations of inorganic crystal with limited
atoms in the unit cell. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant
deep generative model for end-to-end CSP from Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD).
Unlike previous methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD
as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation
of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet
comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module
that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal
Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures
conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and
hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match
Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 datasets in conditional crystal
structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet represents a significant
advance in CSP, enabling the prediction of complex structures from PXRD data
without the need for external databases or manual intervention. It has the
potential to revolutionize PXRD analysis. It enables the direct prediction of
crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for
manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for
automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of
novel materials.</p>

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important
role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this
equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible
representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such
operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this
work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the
computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the
commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are
integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients,
the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between
spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective
further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from
spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication
between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be
efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms.
This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps
from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of
irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which
serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across
different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and
3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved
performance of our approach.</p>

          <p>This work introduces E3x, a software package for building neural networks
that are equivariant with respect to the Euclidean group $\mathrm{E}(3)$,
consisting of translations, rotations, and reflections of three-dimensional
space. Compared to ordinary neural networks, $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant models
promise benefits whenever input and/or output data are quantities associated
with three-dimensional objects. This is because the numeric values of such
quantities (e.g. positions) typically depend on the chosen coordinate system.
Under transformations of the reference frame, the values change predictably,
but the underlying rules can be difficult to learn for ordinary machine
learning models. With built-in $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance, neural networks
are guaranteed to satisfy the relevant transformation rules exactly, resulting
in superior data efficiency and accuracy. The code for E3x is available from

          <h3>Paper abstract</h3>
          <p>Accurate detection and analysis of traces of persistent organic pollutants in
water is important in many areas, including environmental monitoring and food
quality control, due to their long environmental stability and potential
bioaccumulation. While conventional analysis of organic pollutants requires
expensive equipment, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has
demonstrated great potential for accurate detection of these contaminants.
However, SERS analytical difficulties, such as spectral preprocessing,
denoising, and substrate-based spectral variation, have hindered widespread use
of the technique. Here, we demonstrate an approach for predicting the
concentration of sample pollutants from messy, unprocessed Raman data using
machine learning. Frequency domain transform methods, including the Fourier and
Walsh Hadamard transforms, are applied to sets of Raman spectra of three model
micropollutants in water (rhodamine 6G, chlorpyrifos, and triclosan), which are
then used to train machine learning algorithms. Using standard machine learning
models, the concentration of sample pollutants are predicted with more than 80
percent cross-validation accuracy from raw Raman data. cross-validation
accuracy of 85 percent was achieved using deep learning for a moderately sized
dataset (100 spectra), and 70 to 80 percent cross-validation accuracy was
achieved even for very small datasets (50 spectra). Additionally, standard
models were shown to accurately identify characteristic peaks via analysis of
their importance scores. The approach shown here has the potential to be
applied to facilitate accurate detection and analysis of persistent organic
pollutants by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.</p>
